61,Should I get a surface pro or an ipad?,"Not sure if this is the right sub but

Im thinking of getting the surface pro 6 or an ipad pro for college. This will be my first very own laptop and I want to make sure I got the best one.

I need something that can run word, powerpoint, open multiple tabs while working (but still fast), and other things.

I also want to do digital notes so that it wont be a hassle to buy different pens and other things. The ipad pro has goodnotes which I think is the best app since I see a lot of people use it for note taking.

I also think a surface pro would be great since it runs full windows 10. Onenotes is great but the ipad pro has this 'feel' to it which makes it seem nicer to use. Maybe the problem is the surface pen idk.

I dont know what I should get but I know I would want a 2 in 1 laptop.",technology,1577845779,penguinswithtuxedos,4,1,True,2019-12-31

164,Is Uber Doomed to a Point of No Return? They operate like an economic and political institution," Uber is a [bubble](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/), they are a danger to the gig economy, they are a hazard to society, a virus to capitalism, [adversely impact economic welfare](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html), and abuser to the [republic](https://promarket.org/uber-and-the-sherlock-holmes-principle-how-control-of-data-can-lead-to-biased-academic-research/). Uber is simply a scam, a racket, and they have got this far by:

* Having the [best Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-best-biglaw-firms-according-to-general-counsel/?rf=1), political shadow bosses, and lobbyists to sustain their anti-regulation and anti-labor rights strategy in efforts to sustain market power with a non-feasible and [unsustainable business model](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/).
* Successfully manufacturing [false narratives](https://promarket.org/false-claims-and-propaganda-why-ubers-narratives-are-wrong-but-successful/) by [manipulating journalists](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/).
* Recruit and exploit their supply/commodity (i.e. drivers) by using [deceptive practice](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/uber-travis-kalanick-scandal-pr-disaster-timeline). They work effortlessly to ensure that their supply does not have a platform to attain basic labor rights. They are assertive on dodging any expenses associated with unemployment insurance and [workers’ comp](https://promarket.org/antitrust-labor-market-protectionist-pro-competitive/). All this in order to avert paying basic taxes a normal business is required to pay the IRS. Uber places the tax burden on their poor and poverty-income level drivers.
* Having an elite, [A-team of economists](https://qz.com/1367800/ubernomics-is-ubers-semi-secret-internal-economics-department/) (i.e. Ubernomics) working in-house for Uber to step up their lobbyist and policymakers for success. The Ubernomic team conducts [think tanks](https://qz.com/1367800/ubernomics-is-ubers-semi-secret-internal-economics-department/) at the firm to navigate and shape their socioeconomic schemes to fit and complement their business model.
* Using their own employees to fabricate “[academic research](https://promarket.org/ubers-academic-research-program-how-to-use-famous-economists-to-spread-corporate-narratives/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork)” and attach famous economists names to valid their [narratives](https://promarket.org/false-claims-and-propaganda-why-ubers-narratives-are-wrong-but-successful/) with the objective to create and change public policy.
* Innovating [uncompetitive economies](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html) and rapidly dominating their industry at the global stage by ensuring a lack of competition remains in place.
* [Ruthlessly](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html) securing their [global dominance and deregulation](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/) by using a strategy of “[growth at any cost](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/).”
* Price-fixing (hint-hint for the legal minds), bypassing decades-old [anti-trust laws](https://promarket.org/antitrust-labor-market-protectionist-pro-competitive/) and being pillars of molding [anti-trust](https://promarket.org/antitrust-labor-market-protectionist-pro-competitive/) in [labor markets](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22843.pdf) that threaten civil liberties.
* Having a [robust PR](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/) department engaged in propaganda backed by shadow bosses and elites eager to please the firm.
* Their business strategy to increase their margin is composed of flooding the markets with supply (drivers), increasing the price on the customers, and [decreasing their drivers’ pay rate](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/).
* Their comprehensive business development strategy is entirely a [political process](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/) by infiltrating and hacking the political system. They are an equal opportunity discriminator on human dignity and they have bipartisan support to change and create public policy.

It is important to shed light on these sophisticated techniques carried out by a company that inflects irreversible damage to societies and economies. What is more disturbing is that the company gets away with making [false claims](https://promarket.org/false-claims-and-propaganda-why-ubers-narratives-are-wrong-but-successful/) and manipulating the public, journalists, and the media. The company operates a bonafide [PR propaganda machine](https://promarket.org/ubers-academic-research-program-how-to-use-famous-economists-to-spread-corporate-narratives/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork) which is very effective at manipulating the media and the company’s image. Hypothetically speaking, if I was a foreign entity with adverse intentions wanting to disguise myself as a company, and my objective was to destabilize societies and sow discourse between the people and their governments, I would probably name the company Uber and get my [seed capital from Saudi](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-03/the-inside-story-of-how-uber-got-into-business-with-the-saudi-arabian-government).",technology,1577914162,Open_c_Source,11,1,True,2020-01-01

A friend just gave me 2 different power banks. I charged them (charging works fine, they both have 4 dots indicating the cells once they're fully charged) and one of them has a ""flashlight"" function, and they both have 4 leds to indicate the charge. I both took them and plugged in my phone, but it didn't charge.

The power banks (they're 2 completly different ones), seem to just ""crash"" when you plug in an usb and connect it to a device. 

Now here's something I've tried: I took the one with the flashlight, turned the flashlight on, and once I put the USB port in my phone, the flashlight turns off, once I pull the power-bank out it works again. The other power-bank is the same, I connect the USB to a device and it stops illuminating the charge indicating lights.

I think this is weird, as I am convinced that both are full of charge (the flashlight works, the indicator also shows full in both) and this friend told me that they worked perfectly fine when he used it. Am I able to save these power-banks? I mean... they're useful... Anyways, thank you for reading this.",technology,1577970150,DutchPilot2,11,1,True,2020-01-02

 However the Middle East Netflix servers give me a certain type of content. 
 And theoretically, if I wanted to access different content from the Netflix servers in the USA, I should get a VPN and choose a Netflix server in the USA.

Is there a piece like this, or a way I could set up a tablet to do something like this? I could set it up for him, but I am a long drive away to do regular maintainance on it.

234,Done with HP," 

After months of trying to get my printer do to something that HP advertises it does, I'm done. 

The printer will not wake up to print a job, wirelessly, nor will it remember the wifi password after it falls asleep.

You can't stop it from falling asleep. HP calls it a feature, I call it a bug. 

They tell me to change to a Static IP. My provider doesn't allow that. 

So, I could get a new provider (only two in my area and this one is a good one) or I could replace the printer with a new one from a different company, probably Epson. 

I've used HP printers my whole life and have never run into a problem but this is ridiculous. They recognize that there is a problem however, will do nothing to fix it. 

I don't need this frustration and laziness on their part. 

I am putting this here because, since it is no longer under warranty, they won't talk to me and want to make this problem public. And I frustrated as hell. Yes, I'm aware that HP probably won't respond. Will be cancelling my Instant Ink order since the \*\*bleep\*\* printer can't communicate with HP because it loses wifi.

286,"How I built a flight price tracking business, thanks to accidentally running into my wife.","Hello, world!

I met my wife around 5 years ago - all thanks to being on the right flight at the right time. Funny thing is, I wasn't really supposed to be on that flight to Rome. As much as I loved traveling, I was a poor college student and I couldn't really afford the expensive flights.

And then it happened. I was looking for flights to random destinations after wrapping up my project report at 4 AM, and I found a round-trip ticket to Rome (from NYC) for \~$110! It was crazy because the usual prices are at least in the $350-400 range (if you're lucky).

I got super hooked to the idea of finding more trips for both myself and this girl I had met... ahem :D After I returned from the trip, I registered on a bunch of websites to get alerts if there was a price drop. I did get some good deals, but nothing was as crazy cheap as the one I had found for my trip to Rome.

I continued to manually find flights to 'random' destinations on Google flights and other websites, but it was a painful process. Plus, there was no way I could keep an eye on all these flight trackers 24x7 and create alerts for all the places that I really didn't know existed, but are AMAZING for travelers!

Being a student of Computer Science, I figured there must be some way for me to automate my process of looking through multiple travel sites for amazing deals to random destinations I wanted to travel.

So that's what I did. I created a service for myself that'd look for flights from across the internet that really was 'great' for their price. In the beginning, it simply sent API requests and had a bunch of if-else statements. However, over the years, I've added a bunch of Machine Learning and Deep Learning tricks to the algorithm.

Moreover, I have instances of my 'smart travel finder' running on around 14 different servers around the world (who knew looking for a flight from India is cheaper sometimes!).

I started getting lots of really interesting flights: \~$170 round-trip to Cancun, \~$230 to Paris, \~$340 to India... and so I decided to share it with family and friends and friends of friends. Once the list grew to over 200, I thought maybe people would be interested in paying for the service, and that's how [TripFate](https://tripfate.com/?ref=rxs1) was born.

TripFate can be tried for free (for as long as you want) and costs $25/year for the premium plan to cover the costs of the servers and allow me to dedicate more time for further development and support. I am not sure where this brainchild of mine will eventually end up, but it's definitely been a great experience so far!

As we technologists and programmers provide better and better artificial intelligence, do we have an ethical issue to help our communities overcome?  If a computer can do something better than a human, then is there any point to continuing in that endeavor as a human?  

For many this will be a silly question of course, because they understand the 1-dimensional nature of a dedicated AI in the current state of the art and the multifaceted nature of human development.  But the technology is bound to get MUCH better...

Imagine a world where virtually anything you can imagine will is done better by AIs.  At some point, AIs will exceed our ability to keep up with even creative endeavors, even to the point of developing a better human experience and sentience as we know it.  What then is the point of existing if humanity is defined by the limits of the frontiers it has pioneered and how do we define our purpose then if that is no longer possible?

In popular culture this is sure to become a theme at some point; perhaps even to the point of driving depression and suicides.  What answers will prevent this?",technology,1575362141,vplatt,0,1,True,2019-12-03

we can tell you that the final answer is NO!  
The truth is hundreds of second-used cellphone shops located in the Tongtiandi market, and they are offering all kinds of materials to do a refurbished phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

##  so What is the difference between Huaqiangbei and TongTianDi?

* The Huaqiangbei electronics market is the biggest wholesale electronics market in Shenzhen, China.
*  TongTianDi Market is a market for a second-hand mobile and parts  in Huaqiangbei.  
The following photos for your reference

📷  
As a result, it gave birth to quantities of refurbished smartphone workshops surrounding the TongTianDi Market.

##     2  Kinds of Refurbished Cellphone Suppliers you need to know 

     The first one is small. About 10-15 trained employees which are very good at refurbishing smartphones. and they usually focus on refurbishing a few phone models or just one brand. They normlly purchase the used mobiles and replacement parts from TongTianDi Market directly, often can not recycle.

     The second is large-sized manufacturers with employees above 100.and they are often in different teams. And each of these teams will be in charge of one working process, such as recycling second-hand mobile phones or used ones, refurbishing parts, assembleing machines, and so on.

So if you are going to wholesaling refurbished smartphones, we suggest you cooperate with largely-sized manufacturers like us.

📷

##      Our Advantages

*       Professional manufacturer team
*       Experiencing  quality-control team
*       Strong marketing team
*       Promising  *after-sale* *guarantee*

      In conclusion, Not only we offer a very competitive price but also can serve your products in the best condition. Thus to avoid unnecessary troubles.

315,"Hi, we are two furious bankers supporting the 99%, join #FridaysForPower to disrupt E-commerce future","Hello World,

Current market conditions became a protection racket for the rich companies. This is why the top 1% of the richest people become even richer and the rest 99% even more poor. The companies have gained the power to control the markets and the gap is increasing.

Who are we? We are two furious bankers and we are sick of money and the rich CEOs. We want to make a movement for bringing bargaining power back to us - the people because we are tired of shopping when consumers have no power.

We fight because we care, we fight because it's time to stop the tech giants and rich companies.  
[See journalists exposing how companies use data to sell you more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZVpbwz6kPk&amp;t=319s)

The world is built by companies in a way that us - the consumers have to do all the hard work searching, running for sales, discounts, Black Fridays, be manipulated with prices based on our data and have no power in telling what we want to buy and how much we want to pay for it.

We challenge it and the whole retail world to be wrong, why? Here is how current market works:

**- Consumers have no VOICE or POWER to bargain companies**  
You are just 1 person and you have no bargaining power in front of giant companies that created this retail world. And it barely helps with laws and regulations to control it. But what if we said we can all together create a new market, turn it upside down? What if instead of consumers running for Black Friday sales and hunt for products the companies would run to compete for you and try to win you as a customer? That feels like power is getting back to consumers.

**- The price of something is always equal to its value - wrong!**  
If you are the CEO like Amazon who is one of the richest people on earth but pays the lowest wages in the market, does he bring the same value to the world as his worth? Bullshit. People are paid for “what they have the power to negotiate”. Same with product prices! Why can’t we negotiate it in the shops? Fixed prices are there not because companies can’t afford to sell it cheaper, it’s because they became more powerful than consumers! Pretending to make us think this way! Putting sales and discounts so we would do the hard work searching and running around.

We fight to create the NEW MARKET for e-commerce, the “right market"" for everyone and we have the tool - [RVLhub.com](https://www.rvlhub.com) to do it, we are not doing it for the money, it’s not for profit! It's the start of a big movement and we follow these principals:

**- I can decide what I want to pay for my products/services**,   
I can put my own price tag and make myself Black Fridays every day.I don’t have to accept fixed prices in the shop. If I don’t get what I want, I reject it all and let companies do the hard work again trying to offer me the best price.

**- I can put a request deciding my own conditions**I   
can ask for eco-friendly products, support climate change companies or I can demand longer guarantees, faster delivery times etc. or else I don’t buy! No money - no company power.

**- Let companies do the hard work for my hard-earned money**  
Let them compete in a head to head direct competition with other companies for my requests. All I have to do is accept or reject. If I pay, they better work for my money.

**- No more manipulation on consumer data**  
Companies can’t see what I search, my age, my likes etc. no more data. I tell what I want and they give it to me!

We are 10K angry consumers and counting! Join the change in our [E-Commerce Forum](https://rvlhub.wixsite.com/rvlhubforum)

Currently, I use Google Photos and/or DropBox. But I found out DropBox isn't that great because people have found that it's not as secure as it should be (?). And well Google Photos is only somewhat secure even though it offers unlimited storage, which is what I was hoping to have.

 It's not a very long debate, and the answer to that may be pretty obvious, but I wonder what kind of blindness some entrepreneurs face today. For example, I've seen many cases of a company using open source technologies and to gain advantage over competition, develop things like extra functionality in the technology they use, attach all their systems to such functionality, it doesn't take long and the community is already far ahead of what they have developed, which makes the migration process much more difficult, while any other company that can adapt their systems to the new features developed by the community will be far ahead, which blinds them to the point of Instead of producing proprietary software that will soon be legacy, do not collaborate with open projects directly, so move forward so that they can adapt their implementations to it?",technology,1572843557,reb00t-one,5,2,True,2019-11-03

30,Need to catch a creep - best Android surveillance app?,"tl;dr: What are the best motion/audio activated surveillance apps for Android? Ideally one that uploads the footage to email or Youtube. Also any tips/ideas on how to catch this snooping weirdo/creep are welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancee has a room mate who we're convinced sneaks into her room. She and I talk on Discord a lot and we fall asleep together on there. She's 5 hours behind me so when I'm leaving in the morning it's 3am there. Twice before hanging up I've heard her bedroom door open and close.

&amp;#x200B;

Her laptop screen switches off so when they come in they can't see that someone is there, I saw them walking around once like they were looking for something. She's a deep sleeper and didn't hear anything herself at first. However the past two nights she's blatantly heard someone closing her door and leaving. She can't install a lock due to how old the doors are, they're a weird design. She put a necklace on the doorhandle and the sound of this is what woke her the past 2 nights. I was going to say barricade the door but now I want them to come in so we can catch them on video.

&amp;#x200B;

So the plan is for her to sit her phone somewhere in the room with a motion/sound activated surveillance app. I use iSpy for Windows for security cameras and am wondering if there's anything like that for Android maybe with more features?

As to documented lost time, you can receive payment for up to fifteen hours of time at an hourly rate of $25.00 per hour or unpaid time off work at your actual hourly rate, whichever is greater. If your lost time is not documented, you can receive payment for up to five hours at that same rate.

My question now is: Are people already working on that kind of technology?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean yes, we've got methods to move robot arms with our brain already, but I mean, have we already gotten as far as directly sending sensory information to our brain? Like providing an image to the brain and the smell, sound and feel? Are we capable of such things? Or do we have to research plenty more for that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that it's quite realistic to make a device that connects to your brain and while you are in a kind of coma for the time you're in-game it sends all the information directly to your brain.

With that, we could basically create new worlds, because like.. when our brains get the same information it would in the real world it would basically mean we ARE in that game - not physically but mentally. ( We could literally live in a StarWars Universe :DD )

Me: Majority of the places don't use wireless pay such as apple pay around here so, I have to use physical card and also all of this will make hard to opt for apple card.

79,Network Analysis,"**Network Analysis** 

**1.** **What is Network Analysis?**

Network analysis is used for recognizing the most efficient routes or paths for allocation of services. This involves finding the least-cost way in which to visit a destination location in a spatial network. The cost in a network analysis is normally described in terms of distance or travel time. Network analysis can also be used to optimize the allocation of resources.

**2.** **What is shortest path?**

The best route or the route of least impedance between two or more points, taking into account connectivity and travel restrictions. 

**3.** **What is service Area?**

A network service area is a region that encompasses all accessible streets (streets that are within a specified impedance).",technology,1567488313,grace992,4,0,True,2019-09-03

229,Would fb let the user know how many persons secretly unfollowed him?,"Some people really dont have the idea that their posts actually bother other people in a bad way. We all know some people like this. Someone may unfollow him but he still gets no idea and continue his bad postings on fb. He doesn't know people or friends are unfollowing him since fb doesnt show whether someone unfollows somebody. He still post those shitty things and gets some like as well or not. 
But if he gets to know that people are unfollowing him then he might have idea about changing his posting contents or not posting at all. Fb can show the number of users who already unfollowed him not showing the specific users' name.  Then it would be a good chance for one's friends to give their friend an idea that their posts r not  worthy enough to see and those actually hurt the eyes. It would not hurt the friendship since the guy would not know who specifically unfollowed him, he/she will only get the number of the unfollowed persons.",technology,1567523551,iknowwhatudo,1,1,True,2019-09-03

242,Facebook hiding likes.," 

**An engineer has discovered prototype code in Facebook's Android app which suggests it might test hiding the number of likes a post receives.**

Jane Manchun Wong found the code, which has not been activated.

Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, is conducting similar test in seven countries including Canada and Brazil, where only the account holder in the trial can see the number of likes they attract.

Facebook declined to comment.

Some studies have suggested the pressures of social media popularity can affect mental health, particularly in young people.

* **are we addicted to the 'like' button?**

Ms Wong wrote a blog post about her discovery, in which she emphasised that she does not work for the tech giant.

""It takes time to develop, observe, research and release experimental features like this,"" she said.

""Experimental features could come and go. But I am certain hiding the public like counts will be beneficial to the digital wellbeing of a large chunk of users.""

Venture capitalist Ellen Pao tweeted that the change - if it happens - is overdue.

""Social platforms have known as early as 2014 that social media impacts mental health and only now is Facebook starting to hide like counts,"" she said.

Instagram said it was not yet ready to share the results of its experiment.

""We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love,"" Mia Garlick, Facebook Australia and New Zealand director of policy, said in a statement when the Instagram trial was announced.

343,[Romania] My grandparents' router has been hijacked by a Chinese DNS,"So, this is extremely peculiar but, I was just coming here to visit, connected to the wifi and did normal YouTube stuff, all normal right?

Well I went on duckduckgo.com (default engine) and my Firefox has the spoofer to act like it's chrome and Firefox said it's a self certificate, okay, kinda weird, kinda suss, let's see what this is. It downloaded an app that claimed to be google chrome but like 500KB that I now deleted, perhaps I could get a hold of it again if I really wanted to. But it was extremely suspicious, blank pace. I went to see the source, lots of languages with the same message and checks for OS and browser. FIRST MESSAGE LANGUAGES BEING CHINESE. Ok, didn't really think much of it. Spoofed Safari iOS and it less me to a phishing appleid page. So I changed the DNS locally for my phone and then everything was fine.

I thought the issue was some sketchy DNS shit from the recently bought Tenda wifi extender but found no DNS setting, so I assumed it used the DNS of my router. Went to the router settings, **ROUTER CHANGED TO RUSSIAN**, uh big red flag, changed it back to English. Went and checked the DNS servers, with the results being 118.30.28.38 and 118.30.28.39.

7,"Made a “Mistake” on my current medical, how do I proceed in the future?","TL;DR: I already have my medical. When I applied for my medical, I left my heart palpitations out.  

I currently have a current class 2 medical and my medical will not expire anytime soon. I do not have any flight hours or any ratings unless you count the medical certificate. I don’t plan on obtaining any ratings for 5 years but plan on getting my medical and continuing/starting training 5 years from now. When I filled out my form, I did not lie on any of my application but I did not fill out my medical visits as accurately because I was going off memory. I never had any surgeries or got prescribed anything more serious than antibiotics. The one thing I kept really vague on my medical history was when I visited a doctor and they told me I had heart palpitations, which is nothing serious at all. On my medical form I just listed as a visit to the doctor.

When I was around 16 I got weird sensation/feelings in my heart and I went to the doctors and got my heart checked out.  They did an EKG on me and my heart is perfectly normal. After the visit I got a piece of paper about my “diagnosis” which basically had a picture of my heart’s EKG reading and they “diagnosed” me with heart palpitations. From what the doctors told me is perfectly normal, they said I might be feeling weird sometimes because of my hormones. They told me that practically everyone gets them but some people just don’t notice them. I don’t get heart palpitations anymore but they were never a health concern or hazard. In the future when I fill out my medical application or if this is ever brought up? How do I explain this to the AME? Is this something I should keep quiet about because it was never a problem to begin with?  

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know what heart palpitations are:  ""A sensation that the heart is racing, pounding, fluttering, or skipping a beat, often bothersome, but hardly ever a sign of heart disease.  Heart palpitations can have causes that aren't due to underlying disease. Examples include skipped heartbeats, variation with breathing, exercise, stress, smoking, use of marijuana, alcohol, or some medications. """,flying,1577831547,ExistingValue,19,1,True,2019-12-31

21,(opinion) Part 141 school self examining should NOT be allowed,"It's the end of 2019 and I am feeling a little brave and I need to vent. 

I attend a part 141 flight school in the Eastern U.S.  

  
I am afraid of naming the school here because the school owner/DPE is known to viciously seek lawsuits and he actively 'guards' the school reputation by removing bad reviews via constantly petitioning Yelp and Google.  The school's name came up in reddit a few times before and he is aware.  He makes his CFIs regularly monitor reddit (especially this sub and aviation).  So I won't give any info that could give away since I am still attending this school and I am totally at the mercy of this guy.  

This has been an *absolute nightmare*.   All the students cannot wait to get out of this place and some of them even quit altogether because of this school owner/DPE.   Last week some of the girl students broke down and just cried in middle of the students' gatherings from all the stress.  We are 100% fed up with this aviation bullshit where school is allowed to self examine the students, fail them, and charge additionally.   The students and most of the CFIs here who opened up to talk to us about the situation are very certain that the school REALLY wants to squeeze every bit of dollar it can out of everyone here.   It is ridiculous. 

Allow me to ask all of you -  ***how is self examining authority not a conflict of interest?*** 

Every time we fail an end of course / checkride  we have to get re do ground training ($), re do flight training ($$), and pay the re exam fee ($$$)  which comes out to right about $1000.  This is on top of the checkride fee.  

Students who come here usually have 0 flight hours.  We follow the school's 141 curriculum, which makes students take the checkride at exactly 35 hours.   And ALL OF US fail that. I am not making this up.  ALL OF US fail the private checkride.  (the only exception that I am aware was that there was one guy who passed on his first try, but he already had 60 hours from other flight school before he came over here) 

so we did the whole re-training wheel, pay $1000 and redo the checkride at 37\~40 hours.  And guess what?  all of us failed again too.   And the cycle continues.   We eventually passed at 45\~50 hours.... and with $5000-6000 over budget.  The whole 0 - CFI program is around $70,000.    

Then comes instrument and commercial stage.   Of the 30 ish students here, 87% failed their first checkride at instrument and commercial.  And each of us have to cough up a few thousand more to finish.  And oh yeah - he only takes cash. 

Why is this approved by the FAA?

Flight school forcing students do chekckride only in house, fail at ridiculous rate, and squeeze money every time we fail. Isn't this a clear conflict of interest??",flying,1577849846,Purringraccoon,85,1,True,2019-12-31

The SportCruiser fleet at my school has ILS capability, as well as VOR/DME, but just a standard GPS with no RNAV approach functionality. Theoretically I could navigate to RNAV waypoints with an iPad that has foreflight, but I wouldn’t count on it being my primary navigation source. 


Additionally, the SportCruiser doesn’t have to follow ATOMATOFLAMES since it’s a light sport, although I recall filing IFR requires everything in that acronym as well as some extra checks being done for it to be legal to file IFR.


One thing I’m curious about is whether or not it would be allowed to file IFR through 1800wxbrief and checking off what the aircraft is capable of if there’s no IMC, but I haven’t been able to get a solid answer.

(Day 1 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/eg42cy/r44_helicopter_ferry_flight_florida_ksrq_to/), [video](https://youtu.be/6QawW9axLi0))

*In September 2019, I ferried an R44 Raven II from Sarasota, Florida (KSRQ) to San Carlos, California (KSQL), covering 2290 NM in 28.7 flight hours, over 4 days, and captured it in its ENTIRETY in 4K for you to experience what it's like to cross the United States via helicopter, which I present to you raw and unedited! As a newly minted private pilot, it was an incredible opportunity to grow as a pilot and experience aviation outside of my bubble. My biggest takeaways in this trip were in aeronautical decision making (ADM) and flight planning, dynamic weather and conditions I don't typically deal with (e.g. heat, thunderstorms, humidity, and high density altitude), and a genuine cross country experience in traveling between small airports around the country.*  

In day 2, we logged 6.1 hours, covering 445 NM from Jacksonville, Texas all the way to Pecos, Texas. Originally we had hoped to make it to (at least) Las Cruces, New Mexico, though we were thinking given how well the day before went, that we might even make it to Phoenix if we were lucky. In short, we were not.  

The day started off early and on schedule, as we crossed mid-Texas quickly. Due South of Dallas, we passed by 4 Army Blackhawks heading Southwest, which was pretty cool. The terrain was pretty cool, lots of small lakes and greenery that was surprisingly beautiful. We stopped in Brownwood, Texas (KBWD), but some oil and gas from a very friendly guy, and got back up in the air. During the next leg, the terrain started to become more sparse, with a lot of little oil fields popping up. We passed under the shelf of Midland (KMAF), on our way to Winkler (KINK). Winkler was a tiny airport that was unattended, and we stopped briefly to eat, get a break the heat, before getting ready to get back up in the air.  

The next leg proved to be highly eventful. We were hoping to make it out to Las Cruces (KLRU) on this leg, however, shortly after starting the leg, the weather quickly started deteriorating. My co-pilot and I were both making minor comments about the darkening sky ahead of us, and it was him that posed the first question regarding whether we should continue. It didn't take long for us to agree that the best thing was to find the nearest airport to scout the situation. Pecos (KPEQ) was close by, so we diverted and quickly realized we had made the right decision as it was pretty obvious at that point it would have been too perilous to continue.  

The staff at KPEQ was great, and we saw 4 Blackhawks lined up in parking. Upon entering the terminal, I was a surprised to walk in on 25 soldiers in full fatigues, all of who looked up at me simultaneously. I said hello, and filed in to meet up with my co-pilot to investigate the weather. The Blackhawk pilots had been hoping to make it to El Paso, but also made the no-go call and were also trying to figure out the weather situation.  

We hung around the terminal for a while, hoping it might be a quick storm, but after sitting and snacking on some pretty simple yet good brisket burritos, we made the decision to call it a day, as did our Army friends. We made our way into the city at about 6 PM, ate some BBQ, and started to prepare for the next day.  

It was a frustrating way to end the day, as we left a lot of daylight out there, but it was the right choice, and we knew it even if we weren't happy about it. Compounding the weather was the fact that this leg was basically the only way to get through to the West, with Mexico to the South and the Rockies to the North. To make it even worse, it was very sparse, with no attended airports between Pecos and El Paso, and given the distance of 200 NM or 2 hours of fuel, we didn't have much margin for error. In other words, if we found ourselves in a bad weather situation, we might not be able to divert let alone turn around, and unfortunately the corridor was being effectively sealed by a wall of thunderstorms directly in our way.  

We went to bed that night with the trip in serious doubt. If we couldn't get through soon, as in the next day, the trip was in jeopardy as I had to get back in the next few days for work, and the forecast was calling for a solid week of thunderstorms...",flying,1577905420,AceOfRotorBlades,5,1,True,2020-01-01

I know about 14 C.F.R. 121.317(k): “Each passenger shall comply with instructions given him or her by a [crewmember](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=d3d24a831020443b5f202a681f24e446&amp;term_occur=2&amp;term_src=Title:14:Chapter:I:Subchapter:G:Part:121:Subpart:K:121.317) regarding compliance with” seat belt requirements.

How about any regulation that requires pilots to notify passengers of turbulence or any hazard to flight?  What if we are expecting turbulence along our route.  Are we required to notify passengers by regulation?  It's obviously the correct thing to do but is there a ""regulation"" that specifically requires it?  In this case I am being told we are not required to do anything more than tell passengers to put seatbelts on.

45,Changing careers to become a commercial pilot at 30,"So I've gone through about 8 years of schooling and worked for about 3 years now to realize I may want to change careers. I have been looking into ATP flight school and the JetBlue Gateway Select program as possible options. I'm currently in NJ. I've made a pros/cons list for both and wanted some input or even a better suggested option/ if this is even worth doing as a career change. 

ATP flight school estimates around $85,000 for the course and can finish around 1-1.5 years. However, I would spend another 1.5 years or so to build up my hours to 1500 before entering into a regional airline. From there I'd spend another 5 or so years before I can apply to a bigger airline. So timeline would be around 7-8 years to enter a major airline. 

Through the JetBlue Gateway Select program, it's $110,000 for a 4 year program but after completing, I'm directly into JetBlue. So it seems more cost effective compared to ATP and shorter timeline. Since I would be taking out a loan, completing and entering into an airline like JetBlue instead of taking about 7 years to get there would accrue less interest on the loan. 

Can someone correct me if I'm wrong? Am I oversimplifying/ underestimating this? 

I also read a lot about a cheaper option than ATP as well. But I have zero flight experience/time.

He remarked that this was considered modification, that he had received some grief from a DPE in the past for one of his students doing the same thing (although not a discontinuation), and I needed to file for a replacement one ASAP so I have an unprotected paper copy to show the examiner.  It's all of $2 so I will likely do so as cheap insurance, but is this really the case?  I did a little reading, and 8900.1 Vol. 5, Ch 1, §9 says ""Airmen may either use clear laminating sheets to protect permanent FAA-issued certificates or have the certificates professionally laminated, as long as the airman’s signature is placed on the certificate before lamination.""

I remember from physics class a long time ago that PV=nrT.  I know my tank holds 22 ft^(3) of usable O2 (1 atm?).  I assume that's at room temperature, so let's say 70°F.  That should mean 25.8 mol of O2.  At 2100 PSI (the ""full"" range of my bottle), that 25.8 mol should fill 4.36 liters, and I guess that seems about right for my bottle.  So then, 4.36 L at 1100 psi is 13.5 mol, which at 1 atm is 11.5 ft^(3) (326.3 L).  Does that sound right?

83,Question about rudder input during a turn,"Hello /r/flying.

I'm a glider pilot from Switzerland and recently, when reviewing the source material for my aerodynamics theory exam a question arose that I couldn't find an answer to. I thought I was more or less up to snuff on the physics of flight, but I guess not. 

My question is: why do I need to keep rudder applied during a turn? I understand adverse yaw, but that only explains the need for rudder input when starting the turn, not once it is stable. I used to think it's because the outer wing draws a larger circle, i.e. it has a higher airspeed, therefore more lift and drag. But thinking about that, if it produced more lift than the inner wing there would have to be a rolling motion to the aircraft, which there isn't in a stable turn. I'd be very glad if someone could explain this to me, as I'd like for my expertise in aerodynamics to go beyond what is needed for the theory exam, which frankly isn't a lot.

As a lay person, I assume that the ANG provides defense to it's respective state and can be mobilized/absorbed into the active USAF if required. Also, I would assume that due to this, they would be underfunded and supplied with ""lesser"" equipment than the active USAF fleet since they are a state rather than federal asset.

What really spurred this question in my mind was reading about how the Vermont ANG operates the vastly capable but also equally expensive F-35. What scenario would arise where this aircraft would be useful to Vermont in the ANG's ""militia"" role? Why wouldn't the active Air Force choose to replace their aging fleet before allocating F-35's to a very small state ANG branch? An even more extreme example of this is the Missouri ANG's 131st Bomb Wing, operating the B-2 Spirit. What is the purpose?

My question is: How do most glider clubs get prospective tow pilots this endorsement when the majority are using single seat Piper Pawnees? If they are ""Simulating towing flight procedures"", are they just going up in a two seat taildragger and pretending there is a glider behind them? Are they sending folks to other glider clubs with two place airplanes(Cessna 182, Super Cub, etc)?

Departed out of my home airport for the practice area and at the time of departure airport was reporting broken 5000 and 10 miles.

In the cloud I slightly let my airspeed drop to 60 knots in the process of figuring out what to do. However I quickly snapped out of it and got my aircraft in control and climbed out above. After, I decided to continue with my flight and go out to the practice area for 10mins or so. On my way back I was entering the pattern and a strong fog had rolled in and visibility was dropping rapidly. With that I did my absolute best to avoid the fog and land. 

I am disappointed in myself for slightly panicking and letting my airspeed drop after take off. Even though I recognized it soon after it could have gone terribly wrong.

Started heading back to parking and right when I get there, ground calls and asks if I forgot someone. I let them know that I probably did. Everyone had a laugh about it. They cleared me to go pick him up.

118,Overpriced Cherokee 180?,"So I looked at a 1966 Cherokee 180C (1425 total time) yesterday that was listed for sale for 60K... My gut is telling me it is WAY overpriced for what it is but I don't have a lot of experience with aircraft sales so I'm hoping to get feedback on what a reasonable price is.  

 [https://imgur.com/a/N9F1TjE](https://imgur.com/a/N9F1TjE) 

The biggest benefit here is that the engine was factory rebuilt in 2016 and only has 75 hours on it.  The prop is also brand new with only 75 hours on it.  I put a link above with some pictures.  Firewall forward is beautiful.  A loose hanger door hit the prop a few years ago and this guy got the insurance company to pay for a new prop and most of a factory re manufactured engine.  The owner covered the difference after insurance.  Sounds lit he got a great deal.  THis guy has owned the plane for 30+ years.

The rest is not that impressive.  The paint is pretty rough, maybe a 2 out of 10... Most leading edges are missing areas of paint, the spinner looks like a kid with spray paint did it, its faded everywhere... The interior is original, maybe a 5 out of 10.  There is some rust/pitting on the struts.  The panel is original but is IFR capable (not currently).  My gripe with the panel is that if you put all the money and effort into a engine and prop...  Why the hell would you NOT install some kind of engine analyzer?  Other than that, nothing special... No speed mods, no upgrades.  NOT yet ADS-B compliant which is 100% necessary where I live and will be MY responsibility if I were to buy this plane.

So having a new engine is huge but I feel 60K for a plane that needs to be repainted, not ADS-b compliant, has pitted struts, and god only knows what else a pre-buy insp will discover is just way too much.  If it had a GPS or some other decent upgrade from original I might understand.  I know almost all planes are listed 20% over valued but my gut tells me this one is 30-35% overvalued.  I do like the plane and it is close to home so I would consider making a fair offer even of the seller says no.

Would you all please let me know if i'm off base?  What would a reasonable value be?  What would a good deal be(for me)?",flying,1578060112,TheCarefulBurn,43,3,True,2020-01-03

149,The Importance of Packing an Alternate Light Source: the story of losing panel lighting at night over water,"I’m sharing this somewhat long-winded story, for we had things go wrong and right that night with a seemingly small event that could go very wrong with an improper mindset and bad luck. I hope from this that you can all take away a small bit of advice (especially newer pilots) for those of who like to fly at night. 

There’s a TLDR at the end if you don’t feel like reading the play-by-play.
———

To preface, I am a private pilot and my friend has his commercial. We like to take his Mooney M20C around the tristate area (around NYC) with friends for a good meal. One particular night (it happened to be New Years Eve), we were flying back after dropping his friend off at KFRG in central Long Island. As we were heading back to north Jersey, it is generally most convenient to ride the southern shoreline of Long Island. This usually requires coordination with JFK tower to help things go smoothly, eventually passing beneath JFK approach at less than 500 feet above the water for a period of time.

It was past sunset, so things were dark, besides the light of the suburbs and the red lighted panel of his good ole ‘69 Mooney. As I recall, we were beginning our descent through around 1000 for about 400 MSL so we could transit beneath the approach path to the West. At approximately this time, the cabin red lights—the only form of illumination for his gauges—suddenly flickered off, and would not come back on. His instruments were dark and virtually unreadable, save for some residual light coming off of the GPS. Considering our altitude and the extreme difficulty to make out the gauges, it was a situation that was less than desirable.

Regardless, he’s an excellent pilot and I’ve flown with him many times. We both stayed quite calm and briefly worked the situation, to no avail. He notified me we would be diverting if we could not solve the issue quickly. 

But I quickly remembered, I like to pack a little something for flights exactly like these:

A head-mounted red flash light that’s attached to a strap! It’s hands free, and the red light does not diminish your night vision. 

I told him I had it in my flight bag in the back. We were now back in a safe cruise attitude so I unbuckled, rummaged around a bit, and was eventually able to find it.... and voila! It had near full charge, and illuminated the panel quite well. Still, we then notified JFK of our situation, and they were helpful and continued to follow up. Now with a new light source, we did not need to declare an emergency, and continued to safely conduct the flight back to New Jersey.

From the time of the light failure to notifying JFK, approximately one and a half minutes had elapsed. 

As we were notifying JFK, now with the situation controlled and safe, we tried debugging and figuring out what exactly was happening with the airplane. Volts read normal, alternator and battery seemed healthy and operable, no circuit breakers were popped... imminent risk of a larger failure thus did not seem present. A logical explanation seemed to be that the lights themselves had merely overheated. 

After several minutes the lights came back on, but he chose to continue wearing the head lamp, and kept the cabin red light off for fear of triggering the failure again. We eventually landed safely at our destination, a bit more experienced and with a little story to tell. 

———

TLDR:
Had a complete interior lighting failure at night, but luckily packed a head-strapped red light to clearly illuminate the instrument panel and save ourselves from a sticky situation.

Main takeaway: ALWAYS pack an  
alternate light source (ideally hands free and red light) when flying at night, and have it handy or on your head before you even leave the ground!

Thanks for reading, friends. Flying prepared is flying safe!

EDIT; I want to clarify this was VMC. Because of the lights of NYC/suburbs/JFK and keeping a certain power setting, maintaining level flight was not difficult or dangerous while we worked the problem.

154,First ever student solo outbound departure resulted in a 7600!,"This was my first time flying outside of the LFZ and everything was going smoothly. Five minutes into the flight I was handed over to radar and immediately noticed a LOT of static in the messages. I could barely hear but roughly knew what was being said. I then heard my callsign but couldn't hear what was being asked so responded with a brief comms trouble message and to standby. I wondered if I'd changed something by mistake but couldn't spot the issue so decided to climb higher to see if it would make a difference, tried again and it was much the same.

I couldn't think of anything else to troubleshoot the issue so decided it was best I squawk 7600 and relay my intentions to turn back around and head home. I knew they could hear me clearly as I'd briefly heard them say so when I first established there was a problem. Another pilot relayed a message to me that my message was heard and to turn back and change my freq back to Tower of my Aerodrome.

I did so, made contact - and had the same issue. I reiterated my intentions and could just about hear the acknowledgement. As i got closer to the Aerodrome my radio cleared up and I could hear ATC communicating with emergency services to be on standy - this alarmed me a little because it was only a radio issue I was having and I'd wondered for a moment if I'd squawked the wrong code.

As i reached my downwind leg i notified ATC that I could now hear them loud and clear. Rightly or wrongly I changed my squawk to 7000 because at this point I felt that the comms issue was no longer a problem. Normal comms proceeded and as I reported finals I could see emergency services with flashing lights next to the tower.

My landing was as smooth as butter, I thanked ATC for their support and i heard the emergency vehicles being stood down. I taxied back to base, shut down and went inside to report the problem.

As it happens an engineer was in the room at the time who asked if I'd left the landing light on during my flight - I knew I had, because when I went to turn it on during my landing checklist it was already on! He then mentioned it's a new LED light and it's been causing some problems so they're swapping them all out and sending them back! Now, I know I shouldn't have left that light on so I'm going back over my checklists to see why it wasn't turned off. But all things considered I was happy with how I handled the situation. I'm waiting to hear if they'll be any feedback but it was a real eye opener that the training I've had so far has really sunk in.

I still consider myself a newbie in RT because I stumble on my words or mix things up a bit sometimes. But I surprised myself that day when it really mattered it all just fell into place.

I've learnt a LOT from that minor incident. I didn't check any other of my electronics to diagnose the issue, I assumed it was the radio rather than something else. I've had first hand experience of what happens when you squawk an emergency. I also learnt than when you're a student the airport will have emergency vehicles on standby even if it's a very minor incident. This is because theres every chance you could be overwhelmed by the event and make a silly mistake!

I felt very calm and relaxed throughout which surprised me, I even had a chuckle to myself at how eventful my first outbound solo was turning out to be. Pre-memorised checklists, being as clear as possible and not being afraid to squawk an ""emergency"" were all super important at ensuring I got back safely.

2. Someone tells you: ""I want you to take a suitcase with my wife's jewelry and transport it to Heraklion"". Will you execute the flight? 
3. The same case with the previous one, except that you have signed a contract of agreement with the interested party, you know the content of the cargo and that it belongs to the person concerned. Will you execute the flight? 
4. Let’s say that you charge € 5000 per flight. Someone comes and tells you:""I will give you 20000 euros, but I want to smoke marijuana during the flight (legalized by the Government)"" or ""I want to have sexual intercourse with my girlfriend in the back seat"". Will you execute the flight? 
5. ""I am getting married and I want you to fly over the church at the time of the wedding and throw flowers"". Will you execute the flight? 
6. Loss of communications What do you do if you lose comms on VMC/VFR or VMC/IFR or IMC/IFR? How do you know if you have lost reception or transmission? You are under radar vectors and you are going to land. The radar gives you heading to get to the base (before the final one for landing) and you lose comms. What will you do?

173,Independent CFI (w/ access to plane) North NJ / South NY area?,"I'm searching for - and looking for your recommendations on - an independent CFI that has access to a plane in the North New Jersey / Southern NY state area. I'm also open to schools if you think they meet the criteria I outline below.

**Where?** I'm closest to **4N1** (Greenwood Lake, 12 minute drive), and finding someone there would be awesome. **N72** (Warwick) or **N07** (Lincoln Park) would also be fairly ideal at around 30 minutes away.

Other airports that are workable, roughly in preference order because they're around an hour away: **CDW** (Essex Co / Caldwell), **MMU** (Morristown), **MGJ** (Orange County), **06N** (Middletown), **FWN** (Sussex). Or, let me know if I missed one.

**What?** Not looking at this as a career. It'll be a hobby. I'd like my PPL as quick as possible (spring / early summer), and then my IR as soon as I have enough money saved back up to do it. Primary reason to get the license is just because I really would like to be able to fly friends and family around the area - Hudson River SFRA, various NYC sights, Niagara Falls, etc. And occasionally to take my wife on trips. I'd love to fly to visit family in Texas one time, although that'd be the least money-friendly way to get there, it'd sure be fun!

**Why independent?** Two main reasons:

1. **Relationships.** I like interacting with people and building relationships. I'm not super interested in training with someone who's just trying to build hours to 1500 so they can move on, and is only doing this because it's the cheapest way to get to the regionals and then a legacy. I'd rather train with someone who's more experienced, and doing it because they like it; someone who will be there to do my IR, my BFR, and teach me other skills long after I have my license.
2. **Economics.** I'd really like to find a way to do this as efficiently (yes, cheaply, but also time-wise) as possible (more on that below). And, I'd rather pay the instructor directly so she or he benefits more, rather than paying a school that may only be passing along $15 or $20 to the CFI.

**What am I doing already?**

I'm almost through the Sporty's ground school. I plan to take my written exam before I take my first lesson. I'm also studying for the instrument rating, although I don't plan to take that test before I start my PPL training - I just want to have a better ground knowledge. I've technically done 1.9 hours dual before - a discovery flight seven years ago, and then one lesson last summer while I was visiting family in Texas, just for fun and to try out a Cessna 152 to see if it was 'big enough' for me to take lessons in. I loved it. A 150 / 152 would be great, although there doesn't seem to be many of them up in this area.

Like I said above, I'm looking to get into this as economically as possible (thus the interest in the 150/152). And I'm a hyper-analytical / highly-organized person. So, I intend to come to every lesson fully 200% prepared, having studied and practiced on a home sim (X-Plane with yoke and rudder pedals) so that I a) don't waste the instructor's time, and b) can just jump in and start learning. After she or he teaches me to preflight the plane, I'd expect to show up 20 minutes before them for every lesson and have things pre-flighted so they can do the minimal amount of groundwork possible. My goal is to get my license as close to FAA minimums as possible.

I would also like to do as much real-world-scenario training as possible; actually flying meaningful trips during training that simulate what I’d be using my license for post training; this includes interstate travel, Hudson Valley SFRA, Niagara Falls, etc. I'd rather do those things rather than endless hours in the practice area (to the extent possible, and after attaining the necessary skills). Obviously the instructor will know what’s best, but I want the training to be as realistic as possible to prepare me for real-world flying. 

**What do I have against schools?**

**Nothing.** I'd be happy with a school *if I find the right one*. I've visited the one at 4N1 and both of the 141 schools at MMU. I'm not looking for a 141 school. I'm looking for the mom-and-pops feel of a good 61 school. I'd probably just go to the school at 4N1, but I've heard some really bad horror stories from people who say they've gone there (if you have good or bad experiences there, I'd love to hear them). And, frankly, I think their planes are pretty overpriced compared to the condition they appear to be in. So, I guess I just haven't found the right one yet. I intend to visit Aero Safety at N07 (Lincoln Park) and Take Flight at MGJ (Orange County) in the next month or so. I'd also love to hear any stories you have about them.

**Have I considered clubs?**

Yes. I have a spreadsheet of all the clubs. Skywagon and 150th Aero (both at MMU) seem like good options. I hope to go to a 150th Aero club meeting in the next month or two. It's just that MMU is an hour away, so I'd really like to find something a little closer - at least during the training period - if possible. But, I'm not ruling them out. If you know instructors there, please let me know.

**Have I searched for independent CFI/I's in the area?**

Yes, endlessly. Most of the sites that list them are out-of-date. Other CFI's that I've contacted only teach ""advanced"" students - IR, CPL, ME, etc (guess they're tired of hard landings).

I did find one that seemed promising. After talking to him, I was really excited - he seemed like a perfect fit. He has over 8,000 hours, and says he does this because he enjoys it. After a long conversation on the phone with him, his communication style and curriculum / teaching style seemed to really fit. He had access to planes that his past students allowed him to instruct in, and the owners would add me to the insurance when I was ready to solo. The planes were really economical for this area (most planes in this area are $175 an hour wet for a 172 with a six-pack; he said his would be around $100 to $120 wet). The one problem? He charges $125 per hour for instruction. I'm totally willing to pay someone what they're worth, but $125 per hour seemed like way more than I've seen anyone on here ever quote. At first I rationalized it, thinking that I'd save $50 per hour on the plane, so I'd just be paying him that $50 more. My biggest concern, though, is that I've heard so many horror stories of people getting strung along and their instructors making them do more and more hours than they ever expected. At $125 an hour, I certainly can't take that risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I didn't intend that to be so long. That's six months of planning and thinking all dumped into one post. Short version: really would like your recommendations on any part of what I wrote above, but especially if you have any leads on excellent instructors in my area who can make learning as effective and efficient as possible, and who want a highly-motivated student who will put 200% into their learning.

I [rented the Arrow](https://imgur.com/a/iiqI2qZ) I used to fly all the time (70 hours in it), before I defected to Mooneys. Last time I flew the Arrow was almost 2 years ago. The M20F is still down getting an engine overhaul; I've been logging non-PIC hours working on my MEL add-on in a Duchess, but haven't otherwise been flying. But needed to make a $400 wine run.

The Arrow has had a lot of work done to it. New interior. Dual G5s. Various electronic instrumentation replaced ancient stuff (OAT, volts and amps), but some crusty stuff remains (fuel gauges, EDM-700, etc.; ancient Piper autopilot that I now don't know how to use - it used to track the heading bug; newly added controls suggest it should now track NAV1/NAV2/GPS, and there's a circuit breaker for a GAD29... but bugger if I could get it to work). (Now if only something could be done about the paint... It used to be just 'old.' Now it's ... Truly sad.)

(Pilot side PTT doesn't work. Dig the Velcro-attached spare out of my flight bag. Discover an impossible to remove ""condom"" covering the male microphone plug. Use my flight bag multitool to remove the cover. Glad I found this out in a non-emergency situation, on the ground...)

SoCal TRACON gives me the Bravo clearance I suggested would be doing me a solid, and I'm climbing. Hard. Like, &amp;gt;1200 fpm from sea level, ~900 fpm at 3000'. Three blade prop, fresh engine, just me and full fuel, on a 16°C, 30.33"" Hg day.

The controller at SCT asks me how the Arrow is flying with its new engine. I know the story. (A pilot I knew - we're Facebook friends, for all that's worth, and she once bought me dinner - departed SMO IFR and, seconds after hitting the soup, gets vectored for an emergency return with a very rough running engine. One CHT was over 700°F. The top of the piston (crown?) looked like hamburger.) This was the controller who worked that emergency. ""You got an award for that, right?"" ""I did!"" (It's a slow time on frequency.)

Land Santa Maria. (Row of jets from KNTD, which is redoing its main runway.) 

(Wait. What are private Israeli KFIR-C2s doing at a naval air station? Or Hawker Hunter Mk.58s? There's gotta be a story here. Anyone know?)


The line guy, and the CSR agent behind the desk, are like, ""wait, where's the Mooney? How's the puppy?"" (I was last here in mid-August, bringing Brian, my white Labrador, home.)

Borrow the Chevy Cruze crew car. Pick up wine. Woman behind the counter gives me the low-down on area airports and hangar availaility. Her dad flies a C185. (I'm thinking, seriously, about moving to the central coast. I'm kind of over L.A. And my dogs would love to have a yard. And at least one sheep. To herd.)

Bring the plane back. Shoot the shit for a minute. Head over to the airport restaurant. As I'm having my post-flight beer, I get a Furbo alert - Astrid (my crazy pup) is barking. I shut her up with the microphone feature. The wait staff clusters, they want to see Brian.

And following with the site rules, I offer a comment along the lines of this post. 

Do not focus your attention to the date of the article.  Although in general terms the word News means fresh, what this article is pointing out -I am not a pilot or a trainer, but I work in the industry anyways so i have a bested interest in its trends- as I was saying; the problem of pilot obsolescence by forecasted mid of this decade is very real. 
The lack of “ab initio” realistic programs in the industry is still huge.  
With the current economy potential students (kids attracted to flying for the very same reasons always had been attracted to it) are finding out that the cost is unaffordable.  The access to referents from the internet that they have, tells them that unless they are super rich they will not gamble into becoming a pilot (current cost in US averages $72,000 just to get your ATP certification) as they cannot afford it.  
Air Lingus offered their Ab Initio class last year.  A quick google search lands me into traditional training schools that incorporate language along the lines of the “AB Initio” concept but, transparency is not there to enable me to figure out the real cost, benefit and career expectative of pursuing this field, today.  

I am going to pull a big question out of my head (too polite to use vulgarities) to you; 

When will autonomous flying become te norm for passengers?

As we move into accepting autonomous vehicles (ground) and our (general population) acceptance of that new norm becomes factual day-to-day reality, the military has been introducing UAV for almost 30 years now.   

So it is not just a matter of technology readiness so much as accepting that human in the loop will be replaced by autonomous navigation systems.  The psychological factor of accepting this reality would be the highest challenge.  But the industry that moves us around the world is figuring this out.",flying,1578189729,8VizHelmet23,20,0,True,2020-01-04

196,Ticking time bomb: the A320 fume issues,"I'm growing more and more concerned about the frequency of similar fume events on A320 series aircraft. Has anyone else been following these?

If you're not familiar, attention to these fume events started increasing after a Spirit pilot died about a month after inhaling the fumes back in 2015. They are thought to be engine oil and lubricants which are blown into the cabin through damaged bleed air seals in the engines. The contaminants have a distinct ""dirty sock"" smell and contain some of the same chemicals used in neurotoxins. The generally result in dizziness, nausea, and eye and throat irritation. 

If you go to AvHerald and type in ""fumes"" you will see hundreds of these events reported, the vast majority on the A320 family. Most are uneventful, but recently there have been a few disturbing ones, for example a British Airways flight where both pilots were nearly incapacitated, and another BA flight just three days ago where the FO actually passed out. 

Despite these incidents no agency or manufacturer seems to be taking the fumes issue seriously. Simon, the creator of AvHerald, attempted to do some research back when the Spirit incident occurred, but was aggressively stonewalled by the FAA when he pressed them on the issue. 

What will it take before the industry addresses this issue? Yes, the A320 has flown for 30 years and this has not yet caused an accident, but as the fleet ages and more and more of these fume events occur, you have to wonder if it's only a matter of time before the fumes incapacitate both pilots. Is that what it's going to take for the FAA to get off their ass and address this?

Pilots at major airlines, has your airline done anything to address this issue internally? I am flying on a couple of A320s in a few days and am obviously a bit worried.

Edit: to the doubters, I love how we are suddenly taking the FAA's word for granted. You know, the agency that covered up for the MCAS issues and allowed Boeing to sell an inherently dangerous plane that killed a couple hundred people.

4. The answer to the question above is 220°, apparently our inbound minus the degrees. 280° - 60° = 220°, and we should do a left turn to 220°???

228,First Solo 36.3 Hrs - Finally!,"Well I finally got to solo today. I had my first official lesson on May 30th, 2019 at KVBT in Bentonville, AR. Timing was really rough for me. I work a M-F 8-5 job so most of my time was late in the evening, or weekends only once it started getting dark early. My instructor and I have been scheduling 2-3 flights a week, but the weather bug happened to hit my days/times a TON. All of my maneuvers are really good, it's just been cleaning up my landings. 

Well here is it Jan. 5th, and everything finally lined up. Weather this AM and early afternoon was clear, but winds of 270@15. Not great on a 18/36 runway. I kept a close eye on it, and around 1PM it started dying down. At my 3PM scheduled time it had shifted to 360@08. Perfect!

I've been flying an old steam gauge 160HP 172 for most of my training, but it was down for it's 100hr. 172WN is 180 HP with dual G5's and a GTN650. My instructor and I did about 4 or 5 laps to get me used to the differences and make sure my landings were clean. After that, he endorsed my logbook, and off I went.

First lap I was totally not ready for how quickly the plane would jump off the runway without the extra person. It was climbing at over 1k FPM. I over shot pattern altitude by about 200 feet before I even turned crosswind. We are under a Charlie shelf, but luckily that starts at 2900, so I was safe by a couple hundred feet. Everything was good came over the numbers @ 65, rounded out, but flared to early. I ballooned, it started to come down again, but I decided to go around. Full power, dump some flaps, and off I go. 

Second lap I came in really well, but was a little flat. I didn't flare enough that time. On the last lap everything clicked. I nailed my speeds, and greased that thing. I definitely let out a ""Fuck Yeah!"" on that one.

237,To anyone feeling frustrated...,"**This is long. But I hope it helps anyone on this sub who is struggling right now.**   


It wasn't very long ago that I was sitting in this same chair, typing up a post on this sub about how truly frustrated I was. It's fun to look back and [read it now](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/bvo71p/frustrated_looking_for_some_advice/). It took me over a year and a half to get my PPL. I remember wanting to give up. Fourteen months had passed between my first solo and my checkride.     
I'm 18, and I want to do this shit for a living one day. Flying has been my calling-card ever since I was a little kid. Nothing has or will deter me from achieving that, but my patience has been tested. If anyone out there is feeling stuck, lost, or doesn't know how to go forward, this is for you.    


I started taking lessons seriously in January of 2018 (I was 16). I had roughly 30 hours of flying time already, although they weren't part of a regimented syllabus or anything. Suffice it to say; I wasn't starting cold. I already knew the basics of flying, I was already fluent over the radio, I already had a couple of landings under my belt, etc.      


I live in a northern US city, so January weather isn't always kind. Not that it's the fault of the flight school or myself, but it did mean weeks between lessons, which, intern, means repeat lessons.     


Every time I flew, it was the same shit. I probably spent two months just practicing ground reference maneuvers. My part 61 school had stage checks as well, meaning I couldn't progress until I proved to another instructor that I wouldn't kill myself in a plane. Scheduling was a nightmare, getting all the groundwork and flying in was a separate nightmare, and it meant MONTHS of quite literally stalling and waiting to prove to someone what I already knew, that I was a competent and safe pilot.    


It was **June** before my very first stage check. Five months into taking lessons with this school. I was probably up around 50ish hours at this point. Looking back, the stage check environment was more stressful and rigorous than the checkride itself. I guess that's a good thing, but as a 50-hour pilot who wasn't even trusted TO LAND the plane, being told that every little thing you do is wrong DESTROYS your confidence.     


The pages of my logbook were filled. In the ""remarks"" box, each lesson from that time reads the same thing. Two pages worth of ""slow flight, power on, power off, turns around a point, and MAYBE one landing."" It's funny to read now. I spent every lesson between June and August of 2018 in the damn pattern. Five at a time, seven at a time, ten at a time. ""Cessna 172AB, runway one-six, cleared for the option."" I did finally rack up some landings with about 60 hours under my belt.  I finally took my second stage check that August, then and only then, with about 65 hours and 30 some landings, was I finally allowed to solo. Most people talk about those first solo jitters they had. I didn't have any. All I could think was ""holy fuck; this should have happened months ago."" I'm told afterward that I was *""75% of the way there.""* Little did I know, I wasn't even halfway.     


*If you've read this far, kudos.*    


My entire junior year of high school passed (from August of 2018 to May of 2019) without making barely any progress. The weather got worse, and I was in for a slogfest of **cross country after cross country.** I ended up with over **35 hours** of cross country time when I finally got my license. It even made the DPE do a double-take when he saw my logbook. Let me make that clear, I nearly fulfilled the entire total hour requirement for my PPL with just cross country time.    
I remember sitting in the left seat of the 172 with my instructor (who started when I started and is now going off to the airlines) telling me every little thing I was doing wrong. Granted, that's what an instructor should be doing, but when I would come home from lessons, my confidence would be in ruins. Here I was, a near 90-100 hour pilot who couldn't even dead reckon to save his life. 'What does that say about me?"" I remember thinking.    


I thought about quitting. My no-shows were getting more and more frequent. I didn't think I was cut out to achieve what I had wanted to accomplish since I was a toddler. It got so bad that nearly **one whole year** after my solo, my flight school threatened to drop me as a client. Flying wasn't fun anymore. It was a chore to sit in that plane and get barked at after my 10th unusual attitude maneuver.    


*It almost did end. I almost gave up.*   


I finally pulled my head out of my ass and finished. Quitting wasn't an option for something I so desperately needed. I was milked for lessons, was told I wasn't good enough and was dragged through all the shit any student pilot could be dragged through. Months and months more of checkride prep got me over **115 total flight hours** when I finally passed my checkride on October 7, 2019.  Remember, I started in January 2018.     


My experience taught me not only a lot about flying, but a lot about life. Nothing worth doing is easy. If you're frustrated, down, feeling shitty about where you are on your way to accomplishing a task, it means that the task is worth it. I saw flying friends, who were my age, get their certificates within months of starting. It made me feel awful. It made me feel like there was something wrong with me that I was just not cut out to be a pilot. Flying was the ONE thing in life that I could look to and count on during high school (a difficult time for a lot of people).    


Now that I finally do have the cert, I love flying again. I wouldn't trade it for the world. My love of it was reborn, and if you are finding yourself lost and stuck like I was after so many lessons, it will be reborn for you too. Hang in there; it will get better. I would know.

259,"Sad Pax, safe flight","TLDR; don't be ashamed to scrub pax based on weight.  Even if it's awkward.  Make good choices on the ground.

Friend of mine thinking of doing flight training asked if she could fly with me some time, so I let her know I was flying Sunday, she said ""Sure"".  Usually we fill the club 180 to the tabs, but since it was just the two of us and I didn't want to bother with fueling when we got back from the 1.5 hour quick XC, I asked the other club member to fill-er-up.  20 mins before I go to pick her up, she says ""Blast, had something come up, but my husband is super interested if the seat's open"".  I said ""Hell yeah!"" and picked him up instead.  

I threw a placeholder guess in the weight and balance, and we were going to comfortably under gross, but right on  the CG envelope.  We pull into the hanger, do the pre-flight, and then I knew I had to ask the uncomfortable question... ""So I hate to have to ask, but just to make sure, you're not over 260, are you?"".  He's apparently a very dense dude, closer to 310 he says.  Sheepishly, I have to say ""Damn, I feel like a total A-hole, but we can't fly.""  If we were fuel to the tabs, we'd be back to legal, and by the time we landed would have been even better.  The other option would have been to throw 150 pounds of ballast into the rear baggage compartment, and be 13 pounds below max gross, but I haven't flown that heavy and didn't want it to be my first try (it was pretty windy).  

I offered to still hop in the plane on the ground and go over the cockpit environment etc, and he was excited to do that still.  He even offered to still do my flight, and he would come back and pick me up (we're like 5 minutes from the airport).  So I still flew, just with an empty pax seat that I felt mildly guilty about.

296,Tripped alternator breaker mid-flight (twice!),"This probably isn’t the most interesting story to read on here - I debated if it’s even worth writing up, but I figured if at least one person could learn from it, then it is. 

For some context, I’m roughly an 85 hour PPL and I took a little cross country flight last night, going down to Cape May (WWD) and up the coast to the Barnegat Lighthouse and then back towards New Castle (ILG) in the good ole’ 172. Most of the flight was uneventful (besides a persistent, but not terrible, gusty wind from the west) - contacted ACY approach and picked up flight following as I continued up the coast, but eventually cancelled it up around Eagle’s Nest (31E). 

After doing a few turns around the lighthouse, my passenger and I decided it was time to head back, so we turned southwest to head back to northern Delaware. Somewhere around Hammonton (N81), I slowly started to realize that I couldn’t hear myself on the intercom, and neither could my passenger - and vice versa. I thought that maybe my headset had somehow come unplugged - but ruled that out after fumbling with the cables for about 30 seconds.

The actual culprit - It looked like our audio panel (for what it’s worth, a PMA8000BT) had gone dead. 

The interesting thing about this was that apparently after it died, PTT also went along with it, and apparently the default behavior is to fail open (still not entirely sure about this) and pass everything you’re saying to the primary radio (which had yet to fail) and transmit it, even if you’re not pushing the transmit button - at the time, I was still tuned to ACY approach (but not actively talking to them), so it made for an interesting transmission.

If you’d like to take a listen - jump to roughly 24:30 [here](https://archive-server.liveatc.net/kacy/KACY-App-1-Jan-06-2020-2300Z.mp3). (And if you’re reading this in the future, way after LiveATC’s 30 day limit for archival - I’ve made a Dropbox link for it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hi3y0tdgaom1j6s/KACY-App-1-Jan-06-2020-2300Z.mp3?dl=0). 

I try to get my passenger’s attention - but little did I know that what I was saying was actually being broadcast to all of approach - all while I couldn’t hear what I was saying. The last thing I heard was N75190 calling about my transmission back to approach. 

A few moments after that transmission, the primary radio (GNS430) shut off, and so did the transponder... followed by my strobes, instrument panel lights, and navs - surprisingly the secondary radio stayed online, but I couldn’t use it, so it wasn’t much help. 

I was solely a primary radar target for a few minutes (in the mode C veil) until I figured it all out. If you continue listening to the LiveATC recording, you can hear me get called out as a primary target about 30-45 seconds after my transmission. 

I thought we had a alternator failure. After the initial “oh shit” moment, I decided to try and remain on course as best I could. At this point, we were somewhat between ACY and ILG and I decided it would be best to just remain on course and make my way to ILG instead of attempting to turn back. I wasn’t in any position to bust any airspace anytime soon, so I could continue on for a while in that regard as I figured out what to do.  I started to get this wave of dread as I realized that I wouldn’t be able to activate the pilot-controlled lighting anywhere (didn’t have my handheld this time around) and figured that if things didn’t get better, I’d text someone on the ground and get them to relay a landing clearance for me somewhere (likely ILG at this point). 

Three minutes later, I get this hunch to check the breakers, and surprise - the 60 amp alternator breaker had popped. After pushing it back in, checking the ammeter to see if we in the positive, things slowly started to come back on and everything seemed to go fine. It might have popped earlier in the flight, and I was just now noticing the effects of running the entire instrument panel and lights on battery for however long. 

Called up ACY approach, told them about my earlier “oh no” radio call, and said that everything looked okay for the time being. 

The rest of the flight went fine until the breaker popped once again after we were on the ground back at my home airport. Needless to say, it’s going to be checked out - hopefully it’s nothing major, but still after a scare like this, I don’t want anyone else flying in this plane quite yet.

I think the interesting thing was OV light never illuminated at any time, and nothing else gave me the indication that anything was out of the ordinary. It’s still not entirely clear why this happened (I guess that’s why we have AMEs, right?) 
It’s also neat how the audio panel failed open and opted to transmit everything I was saying even when my sidetone failed - not sure if that’s by design, but it kinda gave approach a heads up that something was wrong. 

Thanks for whomever was in Archer 75190 for calling things out to ACY approach, and thanks whoever was working ACY TRACON last night for trying to get back into contact (even if I couldn’t hear you) and offering to provide whatever assistance I needed.

TL;DR - alternator breaker failed. Unknowingly made a transmission that I didn’t think I was making. Lost basically my entire panel. But everything worked out in the end.",flying,1578408624,JCBird1012,27,1,True,2020-01-07

But what about other ways of doing this, like that mesh being retractable, or even jettisonable?

To keep it short, three years ago at 22 I made a very poor decision on a country road and decided to see how fast my car could go, ended up getting caught doing 35 mph over which was an automatic reckless driving charge (the real kicker here was I was going 100 in a 65). I owned up to it, hired a lawyer, paid a fine, got the points, and there is now a single reckless driving conviction on my otherwise spotless record. No license suspension and no drugs or alcohol involved. I regret this constantly and have made it a point to be as responsible a driver as possible now, but of course this conviction is (rightly) following me around everywhere, particularly while I consider a possible flying career.

First I want to state that my ultimate goal is to become an airline pilot and currently I’m debating on when to start flight school after I graduate. I’m going to community college then hopefully transfer to get my criminal justice degree. Anyways I would like to attend ATP but I know it takes up a lottttt of time of your life so I was looking to just get my ppl at another local flight school while in college that way I’d be able to go at my own pace (2 flights per week) and I wouldn’t be as stressed as to getting my instrument ratings etc. right after the other. But first of all would this be a good idea, considering I will also have a part time job? Has anybody else trained while they were in college? Another option was to just do college first and then go full time training at ATP. And lastly my final option was to work my way into flying in the military (Air Force!) by doing the ROTC program, but I’ve heard this option is really difficult. I would definitely love to serve this country and don’t mind being committed to long service years! Btw I’m in the Los Angeles area and the flight school I would get my ppl is at pacific air flight school but are there any other great flight schools in the SoCal area any of you on here would recommend?

My girlfriend says its obvious I have a passion for flying much more than I do for medicine, but I also know blindly following ""passion"" can be naive. So there's the dilemma...Do I leave a very secure, well paying career that I'm not super passionate about to be a pilot? I know salaries can be good (but it takes seniority), and I suspect the job market is not as stable as medicine.

The weather in the morning was crap, and I was very dubious about flying that day. Overcast skies, fog, you name it, with the local TAF not showing any improvement until maybe 1500 local. But we finished the oral and I went out to pre-flight anyways. I got a feeling it was going to be a good day when 1) the fuel truck pulled up to the plane without me calling and 2) I could see the skies clearing up during my pre-flight.

We did get a VFR METAR and took off around 1300 local, and honestly it wasn't my best flying ever. I don't know if it was nerves or fatigue from the oral exam or what, but I was not as spot on as I had been in my prep flights. I overshot hitting Vx and Vy on my short field take off, and maybe that put me in a bad spot. I felt like the maneuvers went pretty well; we went through slow flight, steep turns, stalls, and even an intentional spin (my first ever, hopefully my last). He had me do my engine failure over a local grass airstrip; I made the field just fine, but didn't hold the wheels off for my soft field landing as long as I could have. He actually had me take off, fly a pattern, and do another soft field landing. After that, I did some S turns and we went home. To top it all off, I was 100' long on my short-field landing.

Overall, it definitely was not my best flying, but everything was within ACS and (obviously) I passed. It was a heck of an adrenaline rush, but it showed me how much I can still learn and improve.

424,"I'd like to go out and practice gliding, engine failures, and engine failures after takeoff","I am a PPL with 100 hours. Every time I fly there are a few uncertainties that come into my mind at different phases of flight. So far my answers to myself have been ""well hopefully it doesn't happen, but if it does I can probably"". But these uncertainties have gained more concern as I've began taking up passengers, as I don't want to impose my own personal risk factors onto others. 

So when I am coming in for landing and I'm descending, I'd like to know for certain how far I can actually glide if my engine went out instead of being left to wonder ""can I make it to the field? or should I pick that less than ideal landing spot?"" If I am taking off I'd like to be able to know for certain, if I have the altitude and the skill to return for landing, instead of being left to wonder ""am I high enough? can I glide far enough to that patch straight ahead?"".

Plus, I feel like it would just be really cool to gain mastery over these kind of skills as a pilot.

My question is, what is the safest way I can go practice this? Ideally I'd like to do it alone without a CFI, starting with just really high margins. Go out to an uncontrolled field, pull the power out at a safe distance knowing I'll make the field, and then go around and do it again just a bit further, and further. Go out 5000ft AGL and then pull the power and see how much altitude it'll take for me to do a 180. And then maybe try it on the actual runway at 1500ft, 1300ft...etc.

425,PPL-Glider Checkride today,"After nearly 20 years, I finally finished my glider rating. Figured I'd do a quick write up as it was an interesting, if very short day. Started off as usual with the oral portion. Touched on most everything from privileges, airspace, who to contact when, flight planning, specific cross country planning given different weather and safety margins since we have no engine, etc. Just missed one really stupid thing, said to contact tower to enter B airspace instead of approach. Gotta love those.

Weather was very clear, if a bit cold, but there were airmets for turbulence active. We discussed it briefly and I continued to collect pireps as well as checking wind at known watch points around KBDU. Tow pilot went up before us and submitted a pirep for light-moderate turbulence. Since we very typically fly gliders in turbulent conditions I made the call to go for it. Prepped the aircraft, did the briefings and hooked in to takeoff. 

On tow the air was rough, but pretty typical of our mild rotor conditions. He had the tow pilot throw in the usual ""emergency"" release when we got around our usual release height. After clearing turns we started with slow flight, into stalls and then steep turns. On the second steep turn, half way through we were in very heavy sink and I announced I would be calling this flight done after I completed the maneuver. Another quarter turn and we lost a couple hundred feet of altitude and had dropped right to pattern height and I then told the examiner that I was cancelling the maneuver to go land. Ran through my checklist and entered the pattern to suddenly find myself in a short lived burst of about 6 knot lift right back up to pattern altitude which was good. The examiner then had me put my altimeters far off the true setting to simulate instrument failure and had my do a slip on final. The wind had now switched to a quartering tailwind, but since we were already on final there was nothing we could do. Late on final he told me to also make this my accuracy landing. Since we had a lot more ground speed than I would have liked and the slight cross, I decided to focus on a safe landing rather than stopping within my accuracy points. At the end of the landing roll, I got a bit squirrelly from the lack of airspeed and ended up just missing my accuracy point by a couple feet.

Once we came to a stop, my DPE announced that we were calling it and my heart dropped thinking I had failed due to the sloppy control at the end of the rollout and missing my point. He very quickly followed up with saying that we had covered everything in a single flight and even though he rarely signs off with just one, that I had satisfied him after how much we were able to fit in. That was great because I hadn't ended up failing and I was also about to tell him that I was going to call off the remainder of the flights due to the deteriorating conditions. Of course, as soon as we started securing the glider, the conditions calmed down (at least on the ground) and didn't pick back up for the rest of the 45 minutes or so I was at the field while we finished everything up. 

All in all I'm glad it's over and wish it had been a calmer day for a checkride, but it was within limits and I think my decision to end the maneuver and land instead probably helped my case.",flying,1578607300,climbak,9,1,True,2020-01-09

438,Had my first equipment failure in IMC (writeup),"Decided to take my first solo IFR flight today since getting my rating, since the weather was perfect to fly through some clouds below the freezing layer and get some actual. I was flying a new (to me) club plane, a Cessna 172S G1000 with a KAP140 autopilot. I’ve had equipment failures before - I flew a (slightly cursed) 1977 C152 for my primary training, and got to experience everything from a vacuum failure to a cracked cylinder - but never in IMC. Anyways, story time.

I was climbing out at about 3000, and was assigned a climb to my enroute altitude. I’d gone IMC around 2000, and knew I had a few thousand feet more to go before breaking out. I’d switched the AP on once I’d gotten established in the climb, and was tracking a GPS course direct to the destination IAF (pretty simple route). I did have terrain to clear,and had just switched on the terrain mode on the MFD when things started to get hairy. 

The first indication of a problem was that my COM2 went out - I’d been hoping to pick up the ATIS for my destination, and it had just started coming in. While troubleshooting the COM2 failure (and checking that my electrical system was functioning as expected), I heard a godawful noise from behind me - which I later realized was likely the AP servo doing something unpleasant. I switched off the AP, but at that point the damage seemed done. The AP circuit had not popped, but everything on BUS2 went intermittent (which in the G1000 means no MFD, COM2, NAV2). I was still IMC, but in a trimmed 500 FPM climb that would get to enroute altitude before the terrain, so reported the malfunction to ATC and requested a VMC altitude/vector out of the clouds. 

At this point it was a basic partial panel situation - but even less problematic than an instrumentation failure (I hadn’t lost anything vital, the main concern was the circuit causing a fire or other electrical issue). Broke out in a few minutes, but was above a solid cloud deck. Quick troubleshooting and pulled the breakers for everything BUS2, and decided to return home and shoot a familiar approach. The approach and landing were uneventful and found on the ground that the BUS2 rocker said he had welded itself in the open position. 

Key takeaways:
1. ATC is your friend. I was in an extremely busy approach corridor during the busiest arrival period over a major Class C under a major Class B shelf. The approach controller still did everything he could to be helpful and offer assistance, including an amended clearance and approach on the fly.

2. Don’t panic. This wasn’t a major issue - I had my AHRS and ADC info. I had all the instruments I needed. My GPS1 worked. Even though things were breaking, it was an entirely manageable situation. 

3. Know your systems. Knowing what systems mapped to which part of the electrical system made it easier to determine what I’d lose by rendering something INOP or pulling a breaker.

And also can I extrapolate the severity of the wind shear by looking at the speeds? For example tomorrow morning the surface winds are forecasted 200/7 while at 3,000 they are forecasted 230/47. My first thought is 40kts of new headwind would add 40kts IAS and opposite if it’s a tailwind. But I know this is only if it’s immediate. I’m sure this won’t be +/-40kts.

463,Becoming a military pilot. Used MJ previously,"Throw away obvious 

I am applying to be in the guard/reserves. I have a strong packet. I’ve been quite successful in life after college, and I want to serve my country, and want to be a kick ass aviator. 

Anyways I have used marijuana in the past socially in college. And very irregularly after again socially. I’ve never been caught, in trouble, or anything for it. Besides a few close friends no one would ever know I did it. 

Anyway  I decided I wanted to be a pilot so I stopped and got all my ratings. Haven’t used it in years. Don’t care to ever again. 

I’ve read online that the air force has relaxed its view on previous use as long as you don’t use it while in service. Fine with me. But these articles seem based for enlisted members. 

The AF form says have you ever experimented, how many times etc. idk how many times. But it also says (prior use isn’t disqualifying but it is for some skills) is pilot one of those skills? 

But there is the security clearance which is most important to be honest. Because prior use won’t disqualify you but lying will in a heart beat. I am an extremely honest person I lie to no one about anything. But this has really got me messed up. 

There isn’t a lot of info online. But there is a mix of stfu and deny till you die to you are fucked, to no one cares just be truthful.

Once I parked, I tested some more and the cables were making a lot of noise. My uneducated guess is that a cable slipped off a pulley. I put a squawk in and a grounding alert for the plane, but it was too late to ask anyone about it.

I live kinda close and definitely in the flight path of a smaller airport too so I hear all the personal planes as well. I hear the engines throttling oddly and see their yaw (I think that’s the word) askew, so my curiosity is, how does that affect the pilot? Do they have to have constant hand control or do the computers control most of it? I think I’ve heard that landing and takeoff are the hardest and obviously the most pilot interactive, but in different air conditions, do they have to shut some systems down and take control? I could also ask more about the combustion in the engines too because I know in different pressures and air conditions, etc. the combustion is different inside (at least in a car and so I assume any other internal combustion engine), but I just want to know about pilot interaction for now.",flying,1578685943,Skadiddlyboobop,28,1,True,2020-01-10

I want to hear you guys feedback on maybe getting my Pilots licence at European Flight Academy but instead of paying the full amount out of my pocket which I don't have enough for. Then instead take the second option they offer which is that you get a job at Lufthansa Group Airlines and then you pay by them taking a percentage off your monthly salary until you have paid it all off.

This sounds attractive to me because I'm not even close to having enough to pay for pilot school and not even enough to take a loan at the bank. I can pay for accommodation but not for both things. Becoming a Pilot is my ultimate goal, which means I'm willing to take risks to become a pilot, but instead of just going into it blindly, I instead wanted to hear what you guys have to say about this method. Or if you have done the same how did you go about it.

I just want to be sure if this is the right choice or if there is a better option, considering that I don't have enough to pay for it myself.

482,Advice needed regarding disqualifying medication,"Hello everyone! I'm a first time poster in this community. I graduated with my bachelors degree in business about a year ago, but this isn't the path for me. Long story short I am very interested in becoming a regional or commercial pilot and taking the necessary steps.

I've realized after doing some research that the medication I am currently on Alprazolam (generic Xanax) would automatically disqualify me from passing my medical which is of course crucial. (Have been taking said medication for approximately 4 years).

I have been planning on coming off of my meducation long before my interest in piloting. So, my question is: Would I still have a chance at passing the medical/physical if I were to completely cease my use of  Xanax for a period of time before applying for the medical? (For example, a year, proving I no longer need it, before applying for my medical).

I had read that if you are no longer using a disqualifying med for at least 90 days there is hope of passing as you don't need to report it? (However, not sure how true that is).  

Upon browsing this sub and other sources I've seen the advice of speaking with an AME for a consultation. Are all AMEs the ""same"", so to speak, who could give me beneficial advice on this matter? I have heard of Bruce Chien, but it seems he is no longer actively consulting with these special cases. 

Any suggestions would be extremely helpful as this is a dream of mine! Particularly from those of you who have dealt with special waivers or similar situations to mine.

487,Busted commercial checkride (and gas fumes which ended the ride): A write-up,"I traveled to the other end of the state, San Diego, and rented an AirBnB for the week to do a 5-day accelerated commercial pilot training program. Still a part 61 program, but reputable and very fairly priced.

The week included about 16 hours of ground training and about 13 hours of flight training. Mock checkride oral + flight was mostly passable yesterday. My checkride was originally for Saturday but they moved it up to today (Friday).

Today, nervous as any checkride candidate would be, I had all my documents and paperwork ready to go. Full briefing, with everything printed. Full ForeFlight nav log printed and marked up with true headings and a space for me to write actual times on. 

I was informed at around 9AM that my 10AM checkride was going to be delayed because the DPE was conducting a re-test with a candidate who had a bunch of paperwork issues and would need to do the entire ride again. So, just as I kicked back to do some Q&amp;A with my CFI (who was great), the DPE comes in and says he’s ready for me. Apparently the plane the re-test candidate was going to use was unairworthy and the flight was stopped before it was started. 

I sat down with my CFI and DPE and he went over paperwork. He was a bit grumpy but I couldn’t tell if this was just him or whether I caught him on a bad day. He paused once to answer a text message from his daughter (and later stepped outside for a 5-minute break to take a call during the oral). After I handed the $800 over to him, we informed me we were now underway with the oral portion of the exam. He had me show him how I was qualified to be a commercial pilot and asked me very briefly about common carriage and what it meant. Answers were accepted.

We talked about documents, inspections, preflight preparation, aircraft airworthiness, my weather briefing for the cross country, my flight plan, etc. He was fine with me using ForeFlight (as I had read would be OK from multiple other debriefs/gouges from other successful applicants by this DPE), but wanted me to make sure I knew whether the wind figures the FF navlog were giving me were in true or magnetic. He seemed satisfied. 

We talked about oxygen systems and oxygen requirements. He sat by while I looked up exact requirements for pressurized aircraft and was satisfied with my answers as read from the FARs. 

Overall his satisfactions with my answers were very hard to read, but eventually I was informed the oral portion was complete. It was about 2 hours with some breaks. He told me to break for lunch and to preflight the airplane and that we’d meet back at the airplane at 12:15. I got the aircraft ready and he met me back at the plane around 12:25. 

All week during the training phase, the database in the Garmin 430 was showing as missing. Not out of date, missing. That meant that only thing the 430 was good for was ADS-B in and maybe terrain. I started up this morning and saw the database had been fixed and was up to date. More on this later.

I verbalized all of my checklists as he texted on his phone on and off. Being a busy airport under a Bravo shelf, the run-up areas are frequently congested and we both agreed I could offset from taxiway centerline to do my run-up just outside the run-up area. As the area cleared, we taxied in and waited for departure. He asked for a soft field takeoff.

As cleared/directed, I performed the soft field takeoff and headed downwind, eastbound. About 3,000 feet (clear of the next class Delta airport airspace; above), he failed my iPad and said to navigate from here. Here’s where it began to go south. I pulled out my paper chart and tuned in the closest VOR and identified it. It was actually on my route so I felt good about using it. Before I tuned it, I realized I hadn’t entered anything on the 430, so I put Direct to the first waypoint on my flight plan. The DPE said “I was wondering when you were going to do that.” At the moment, I hadn’t realized how pivotal that moment was, but in retrospect it all made sense. 

As I’m climbing out, I reach 4,600 feet and the DPE takes control of the aircraft. At this point, I knew before he told me that the ride had been busted. There was a 4,800 Bravo shelf I was about to climb into and I had lost my situational awareness about that Bravo. He explained it as such. The crappy thing is that airspace has never been a weak point for me and I have successfully navigated airspace just fine in the SFO terminal area (and other busy C/D areas) without so much as a near-incursion. I was distracted and task saturated and I didn’t arrrest my climb. The other crappy part is that I WROTE DOWN in my Nav Log to level off below 4,800 and I didn’t have my wit about me enough to do so.

I opted to continue with the checkride. He had me descend to 3,500 feet for an eastbound VFR cruising altitude and then he threw me a diversion. He asked for time, distance, magnetic course, and fuel to an airport. I provided those things with ForeFlight and he was satisfied. 

Next, he asked me to do steep turns. I cleared the area using my CLASS pre-maneuver checklist (Clearing Turns, Landing Sites, Altitude Safe, Safety Checklist, Select References). I made two perfect 50º bank turns, first to the left, and then to the right. I was within 50’ the entire time and airspeed was on point. 

He then asked me to set up for slow flight, which I did. He asked me what my reference airspeed was going to be and I stated 45 knots. Right as I was fully established in slow flight and he gave me my first turn, he said he smelled fuel in the cockpit. I noticed it as well. Fairly strong. He instructed me to abort the maneuver and head back to the home airport. I got the ATIS and he recommended I do a Direct To in the 430 to get us back. He asked me at that point how familiar I was with the area and I told him I’d only been down here for a week flying in it. He gave me some visual landmarks to comply with the straight in approach clearance tower gave me. He then requested a soft-field landing, which I performed completely within spec, to a full stop.

We taxied back without incident. He admitted there are some aircraft at this flying club he absolutely will not fly, and that the accelerated programs like the one I chose tend to “have some issues.” He requested I make the squawk urgent on the aircraft log as to ground the plane until the fuel venting issue was fixed. 

We debriefed inside and he filled out my Notice of Disapproval. “COMMENTS: DISAPPROVAL FOR NAVIGATION. NOTE: ENTIRE ORAL COMPLETE. FLIGHT CHECK INCOMPLETE EXCEPT FOR SOFTFIELD TAKE-OFF AND LANDING, DIVERSION LOST PROCEDURE AND STEEP TURNS...”

We debriefed the whole thing. He was very happy with my oral portion and said it went “really well.” He didn’t have much to comment on my takeoff and landing. We talked about the failure. I explained – prefaced with “this is a contributing factor, not an excuse” – that the navigation database from the 430 had been missing all week and I think that I neglected to use it today because I didn’t expect it to be working. He said two things that are salient: The aircraft is unairworthy with an inoperative piece of equipment that hasn’t been disabled and placarded; and, since it was working, I should have entered my entire flight plan in the 430 as the installed equipment is my primary means of navigation. He also noted that my paper chart should have been plotted with my flight plan, but that I should not have gone to the paper chart before using the 430. He didn’t have much to say about the airspace bust, but it was clear that it was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back rather than the only thing.

Overall, the experience was humbling. Of course, I’m very disappointed, but I can only beat myself up so much for the failure. I’m a little peeved at the fuel venting issue with the aircraft, which I was later told by the lead CFI has been a recurring issue with this aircraft, and that this aircraft is one of the most reliable ones they use for checkrides. So... I’m unhappy on that front. It wasn’t noticeable at all this week with 13.5 hours of dual instruction between Monday and Thursday.

Another contributing factor was the entire paradigm of the accelerated program. I came into the checkride with a 98% on my written and have been studying at home for months. The whole week I was a ball of stress. I managed it well by limiting caffeine, getting 8 hours of sleep every night except last night (closer to 7), and hitting up the hot tub where I’m staying to help relax. Not a single drop of alcohol. I was also in the latent dry cough stage of a cold I’d gotten over Christmas and since mostly recovered from, and was on no medications except for an occasional cough drop to moisten my mouth. 

The stress of this week’s program bordered on undue. I really thought that the accelerated nature of it would keep things fresh. You have no idea just how relieved I am to have ANY outcome after today. After successfully getting my instrument rating last summer after working on it for a year (again, part 61 but at a human pace), and the stress I felt about that checkride, I’m frankly a little burned out with the stress and the high stakes of flight testing. I love flying. It’s been a passion since I was a little boy. The whole reason I got my instrument rating after 10 year as a PPL and am now pursuing commercial and CFI is because I want to go to the airlines. But, this week’s stress and the failure of this checkride has naturally caused me to question these things. The DPE himself shared he had a corporate flying career and was happy to be retired since he just got to spend his first Christmas at home in 27 years. Do I really want that kind of schedule and stress in my life? Even if I wanted to be a career CFI (which I’m considering), do I want the stress of rests, re-tests, a taking on the stress of each student’s testing? What the hell have I gotten myself into?

Then there’s the cost. I spent about $7500 this week. This included accelerated program fees ($3,500), aircraft rental ($1,500), checkride fee ($800), lodging ($1,000), rental car ($300), and food for the week. I had to use a week of precious vacation time to get away from work to come here for this. And, I walk away with only 20% of my checkride done, a disapproval on my pilot record, and only 60 days to re-take the checkride if I want a chance at not having to do 100% of the ride over again.

In thinking toward the future, I have some options. Maybe you can help. First, I could come back, re-train briefly, and take the checkride again with the same examiner. I don’t particularly like this due to the maintenance issues of unknown aircraft and the fact that the examiner just seemed crotchety. Additionally, the expense of taking time off work, flying down here and staying in a busy area to do the training. On the other hand, it would be with the same DPE who knows what went wrong last time. He just didn’t put me at ease like my IR DPE did. Which leads me to my next option: continuing training back at home and getting a checkride with another examiner OR the one I used for my IR ride. This would allow me to do things at a reasonable pace as long as I could get a checkride scheduled within 60 days. I like the area where I did my IR checkride (Sacramento Valley and foothills) because it’s fairly unimpeded from complexities that can be hazardous to a checkride (like Bravo airspace, for example). Perhaps this worry reflects more on my piloting skills.

1,The long road to first solo flight,"I have been building my instruction time toward my solo over the last 6 months.  I currently have 22 hrs and still have not been able to solo yet.  I have taken a roundabout journey training in a c150 to begin with, then joining an aero club and training in a c172 for the bulk of the hrs.  That plane’s glass panel went down as I was about to get my solo endorsement.  I then took a couple hrs in another c172 with steam gauges.  On my last lesson to solo, the attitude indicator failed.  I was on the cusp of my endorsement when I bought a c140.  

The c140 was in annual for 6 weeks and I didn’t want to rent the c172 when I had my own plane.  I found a tailwheel instructor finally, and we had the time change greatly restricting my training availability during daylight.

I'm repping for a commercial check-ride and I have plenty of dual simulated instrument and complex; I did most of my instrument rating and that check-ride in an Arrow.  However, when I logged those flights, I did not specifically mention 61.129 in my logbook as the AOPA seems to require.  I would think it is common sense that instrument rating training covers most areas of 61.127(b)(1) as 61.129 requires except ground reference maneuvers.

My question is this: has anybody had issues on a check-ride with the instrument or complex time not explicitly mentioning ""61.129"" in the logbook entry?

28,I got my instrument rating last week! Here's everything I remember about my checkride," 

The DPE asked me to prepare a cross country from KJVL to KEAU and to do a weight and balance. 

For the cross country I planned via airways with this route:

**KJVL ATOBE V97 ODI V129 EUMBO MENRD KEAU**

My checkride was scheduled for 1:00 P.M. and I flew up in the late morning to have lunch at Bessie’s. Around noon, I repositioned over to the Jet Center and started laying everything out in the confrence room (which the DPE referred to as “the torture chamber”). The DPE was on a checkride so it was a bit stressful sitting in the room quietly for an hour with nothing but my thoughts. 

Once the DPE came in, he was in a good mood and we joked a little bit about checkride anxiety and he talked a little bit about his expectations and the FAA’s expectations. Then we moved on to the eligibility stuff.

## Eligibility

The DPE looked through my logbook and asked me some basic questions like, “did you do at least 15 hours of instrument flying with Craig (my instructor)?” and “how did you calculate your PIC cross country time?”.. I showed how most of my instrument time (with the exception of my PPL training and 1 time with a safety pilot) was with a CFII and I explained how I subtracted my cross country time up to the day of my PPL checkride from the total to verify that. He was happy and satisfied that it was all in order and commented how awesome it was to get photos of it all beforehand.

## Airworthiness

The DPE wanted to see the annual for the airframe, engine, and prop. He then looked at the Pitot Static, Altimeter, Transponder, and ELT entries. He asked me how I knew all the ADs were complied with. I explained that I have a master list from the FAA in the back of my binder and I verified that all the numbers were accounted for in Jim Finefield’s annual log entry with “next due” dates. He asked if I had the supplements for my GPS and other modifications, I told him I did and showed him. (My plane is 52 years old.. there's lots of modifications and supplements to go with them)

## IACRA

At this point, he took his payment and we went to IACRA to sign the paperwork to begin the test.

## Oral Portion

For the oral portion, we started out with currency questions. “What do you need to legally accept an instrument clearance?”, “What if you don’t have 6 approaches in the preceding 6 months?”.. “How do you know what will be covered in an IPC?”. Then he asked what’s the difference between currency and proficiency and how do you know you’re proficient enough to do the instrument flight? 

### Weather

Beyond that we got into weather. The DPE pulled out a binder full of METARs, TAFs, Prog Charts, Satellite images, and photos of clouds. He asked me questions like “if this is the TAF for your destination, do we need an alternate?” and “if this is the TAF for your desired alternate, can you use it?”. An interesting thing here was that the “desired alternate” was reporting 700 and 2 AND it has an ILS approach; however, the ILS approach had Alternate N.A. on the plate.

We got into aviationweather.gov charts and he asked about expected weather in various areas based on high and low pressure areas as well as frontal zones. He also showed a chart with precipitation and wind barbs and asked what the wind barbs meant. I incorrectly said wind direction, but on the particular chart, it indicated cell movement. He even said this was a “common missed question” of his. 

There were a few more questions about weather and cloud formations (mostly cumulus) and expectations if flying into them. This completed the weather portion of the oral. 

### Charts and Plates

The next section was the reading charts and plates section. We pulled up my flight plan and he asked me how I came up with the route. I explained my thought process and he asked why I didn’t file direct or a more direct airway. I explained that, even for VFR, I typically plan airways because I like the backup of the VORs. For the more direct airway route, it would traverse some MOAs, and although not hot, they are are activated by NOTAM and I preferred to add 10 minutes to my route and have a more predictable clearance than get up there and be vectored all over god’s country. He then asked if there were preferred routes and how I looked them up. He asked if KJVL had a SID or an ODP and if KEAU had a STAR. He asked if ATC can assign an ODP, I said no, but he explained that they can, in fact, assign an ODP and told me of when it happened to him. He then asked what would happen if we lost comms on this route and both radios were determined dead, when would I descend and land? I told him that my waypoint of MENRD is an IAF for the likely runway based on the forecast winds. I said, since we’re in radar coverage, I would begin the approach upon reaching the MENRD waypoint. He pointed out that my clearance limit was the airport and not MENRD so this is contradictory to the regulation. I explained that I recently attended an ATC presentation where they made it clear that my plan is what they expect and want pilots to do. They don’t want an airplane going to the airport (and holding because they’re early) and then heading back outbound if they got there by way of an IAF because they have already cleared traffic. The DPE said this matched his conversations with ATC and agreed with my plan. He even said it’s what he would do as well. 

He then started pointing at things and asking me what they were on the chart. Things like change over points, altitude change bars at fixes, what are the blue routes, what are the numbers along the routes. Then he had me pull up some approach plates and asked me to brief him on the approach. The DPE was very big on the notes section. He said he calls them the “notes that kill”. We spent a lot of time on the notes and what every note meant. Then he asked about lighting and inop lighting effects to minimums. Lastly he asked about TAAs vs MSAs and we were done with this section.

### Aircraft Systems

For this part of the oral he asked me what Vy on my plane is and what my cruise climb speed is. Then he said, “ok so you take off at Vy and everything is going well, you’re in the clouds and you look at your airspeed and you are now in a cruise climb… you are continuing to climb and you’re airspeed is showing 130, so you pull the nose up to slow down. You notice it’s still speeding up, so you pull back more and you hear the chirp of your stall horn.. What do you do?”. Obviously the issue is an iced over pitot tube, but the first thing to do is not turn on pitot heat, it’s to lower the nose… Avitate first. We talked about induction icing and how to detect and fix it. Lastly we talked about static port icing and what to expect when using the alt static source. He asked me what the preferred configuration for the plane was for alt static (ie closed storm window, power settings, cabin heater settings, etc). He also asked why the storm window should remain closed, why would that affect the static pressure?

After completing this section, he informed me that we completed the oral portion and to take a quick break and preflight the plane for the flight portion.

## Flight Portion

I did a preflight of the plane and he came out and got in. I went through my standard passenger briefing with him and he gave me my clearance. We established that he would talk to the real ATC and when “DPE Approach” says “Radar services terminated, contact tower”, it meant that I’m to take over the radio communications to the real ATC. We taxied out and I did a full run up. He asked me if I knew how to preflight my autopilot. Earlier in the week I created a checklist from the manual for the autopilot just so I wouldn’t forget anything. I told him, I absolutely did and I pulled out the checklist. He looked at it and said, “you have a checklist, I trust you know how to so let’s consider that done and get going”. 

We took off and “DPE Approach” had me fly runway heading for a bit then cleared me direct to my first fix. I had the autopilot on and just did the needful on my GTN750 and activated GPSS. We climbed to 3000 and I configured for cruise. I leaned the engine and reviewed the cruise checklist. 

We flew to the first fix when he failed my attitude indicator. I reported it to “DPE Approach” and declared the emergency. He came back with “say intentions”. The DPE really liked that phrase and used it quite often during the check ride. I told him to standby, slowed the plane down,  and referred to the 750 for nearest airports which was still KJVL. I told “DPE Approach” that I’d like vectors back to janesville to land. He gave me a vector, told me to expect RNAV 22, and we turned off course back to Janesville. At this point I loaded and activated the approach and pulled up the plate and briefed it. We were pushing serious wind and our ground speed was super slow so he took the controls and we did the unusual attitudes. After those were complete we were back on course for the GPS 22 at KJVL. He vectored me for the approach and I intercepted and flew it down partial panel to minimums and went missed. On climb out he gave me back my instruments and autopilot and we flew out to the published hold. I slowed the plane down and we entered the hold. He also told me to expect the VOR-A at beloit and to expect further clearance in 10 minutes. I started briefing it in the hold. He asked me what the size of the hold was we were in and I had to pull up the previous plate to double check. He pointed out that I shouldn’t be so quick to allow the autopilot to fly the hold without first verifying we are in protected airspace and everything is good. Good point! I did trust the autopilot and GPS a little bit too much at this point… I had 10 minutes to brief, there was no need to start so early. I got back to briefing and I loaded the VOR-A approach. I was expecting a lost comms at this point but he cleared me direct to the fix and cleared me for the VOR-A. He asked me to fly the VOR-A on the autopilot and I told him I was already planning on it. This was a bit of a trick though, the FAF is the VOR so as soon as we got into the cone of confusion the autopilot started to turn us off course. I immediately shut it off and hand flew it until the needle stabilized. Then I re-enabled the autopilot and continued down to the MDA. Once at the MDA he made me stay under the hood until 1.5 miles from the MAP. By this point it was very dark out and identifying the field was difficult. I also forgot to activate the runway lights initially, but I spotted the beacon and we began a circling approach. I got the lights activated and we were coming around to get lined up. He told me not to land and to climb straight out to 2600 feet. I was back under the hood and leveling at 2600 when he tells me that my oil pressure is dropping rapidly. I immediately called “DPE Approach” and stated I’ve lost oil pressure and I’m declaring an emergency. Of course I hear “Say Intentions” then he says “I can offer vectors to the ILS 32 at Janesville”. I responded with “I’ll take it”. He turned me and I began to prepare for the ILS 32. I told him I would pull the cowl flaps and I pulled the manifold pressure while leaving the prop at a high setting. He said “The oil pressure is at zero and your CHTs are climbing rapidly.” I quickly loaded the ILS 32 into the GTN 750 and set the HSI to 320, verified vloc and the ILS frequency. I then pulled out the checklist and verified that there was nothing more to do about the oil pressure loss. We got established on the localizer and he asked me what the DA was. I informed him that I didn’t really have time to pull up the plate and frankly don’t care what the DA is at this point. There’s no option to go missed anyway. The engine is going to quit at any moment. I’m just going to get us down and over the runway and if we go off the end, so be it. I did find some time inbound before reaching the FAF to pull up the plate and reviewed the vital details of runway TDZ elevation and the published DA so I knew what to expect in terms of altitude when the wheels would touch down. About 100 feet from the DA he told me he could see the runway lights and I could look up and land. We had a nice greaser landing and taxied back to the jet center. The DPE congratulated me on passing my instrument checkride and we went inside to put a hole in my PPL card and get the temporary cert printed and signed.

Things I spotted that seem off:

* The plane is a Cessna 421.  It's paint an interior seem quite old and worn.  But given the date, it had to be less than 10 years old (how fast can a plane age?).
* The panel is visible, and is full of modern LCD-screened avionics (is that a GTN750?)
* The plane is started without moving the mixture out of full lean, or throttles off of idle.

79,What scares me the most about airplanes.,"So I know flying is super safe for many reasons. For example the amount of redundancy on almost all parts of an airplane. You got several engines, multiple autopilot systems, control systems, radio systems, 2 pilots, etc. And even if all that stuff fails for example all 4 engines blow out, you can still fly and land the plane safely with just the wings. That is if the plane still has wings. I know this sounds silly because plane wings are supposed to be super strong. But I just cant help the feeling that they are giving out each time I'm on a turbulent flight. And the crappy thing about airplanes is that no matter how many redundant engines or anything else you have, you cant fly a plane without wings. So this has become my one big fear with flying. There doesnt seem to be any redundant system for wings. I know smaller planes have parachutes and f150 pilots can eject them selves from a plane but with normal airlines there doesnt seem to be a solution. It doesnt help with all the current drama going on with boeing and the fact that their 737 ng planes have recently found to have 1 inch cracks on the pickle forks of the wings which is what is supposed to be a very important component. I know flying is still super safe but until a redundancy solution is invented for wings I dont think I can every truly feel calm on a plane until I am safely landed. If anyone can make me feel calm about this or explain just how strong wings are that would be awesome. Thank you.",flying,1575363126,ilovemagikarpforever,6,1,True,2019-12-03

96,I learned about flying from that: Silly mistakes edition.,"TL;DR: Had a ""surface incident"" due to my complacency in checking NOTAM's. 

This happened a few weeks back. Gorgeous Saturday, not a cloud in the sky or even the slightest breeze. Decided to go for a $100 Korean BBQ run with some friends, to an airport I have landed at many times. About a 30 minute flight, and the destination airport it pilot controlled, and not typically super busy. Given that it was such a gorgeous day, and such a familiar flight, I didn't get a full briefing. 

I did do some basic checks, such as looking for TFR's and pulling up the airport page on Foreflight, where it typically shows a red box that lists NOTAM's. I discovered there was a TFR near the airport set to go into effect later that day (well after I would depart) due to a football game at a nearby college. On the airport page of Foreflight, something popped up saying that one of the two runways was closed, but no other NOTAM's.

We made the flight there, really uneventful. The AWOS mentioned the NOTAM about the runway being closed, specifically that it was closed to serve as a parking spot for aircraft coming for the nearby football game. It also gave taxi directions for folks coming for the game.

Had lunch, came back, started up, and listened to the AWOS. Same mention of the runway closure, and taxi instructions. Made a call on the CTAF announcing my taxi, and headed towards the runway. I was almost to the runway, when the FBO contacted me on the radio to let me know the temporary ground controller needed to talk to me. 

To say I was surprised would be an understatement. I hadn't the slightest clue they had a temporary tower operating, with a ground frequency and tower frequency separate from the CTAF. It went into operation after I arrived, but right before I departed. I called up the ground controller and he gave me taxi instructions, which was a little funny because I was pretty much at the hold short line at this point. He didn't make any mention of my indiscretion, no number to call or anything, and I got takeoff clearance and went on with a normal return flight. I did go ahead and file a NASA report when I got back, since this could be classified as a ""surface incident.""

Overall, this was on me, as it is my responsibility to THOROUGHLY familiarize myself with the NOTAM's for every flight, and I let complacency come in the way of that. I have been flying around this area a long time, and thought I knew it like the back of my hand. Didn't consider how a football game would affect the local airport. Had I gotten a full briefing, I would have seen the NOTAM, and ordinarily, it would pop up on the airport page on Foreflight, but I guess it glitched out. 

That being said, it did seem a bit odd to me that the AWOS made mention of the runway closure, but no mention that there was a temporary tower operating. Additionally, the fact that the AWOS gave taxi instructions seems to make it even less likely that there is a ground controller. I think I understand why the tower operated on different frequencies from the CTAF, but it does make it pretty easy for somebody to show up talking on the CTAF/UNICOM, and the tower wouldn't know unless they visually spot them, or the FBO folks tell them.",flying,1575395687,solodaninja,19,1,True,2019-12-03

Originally my goal was to find partners local to me with a strong preference of Oxnard Airport to buy in to an instrument capable Mooney, or something similar.  But I've been doing some research and think I may have a better plan.  I wanted to run the plan up to the community to see if it is sound.

I found CP Aviation at Santa Paula airport.  KSZP is only 15 minutes from my house.  They have very good rental rates, especially on tailwheel planes.  I'm planning to earn my tail wheel endorsement this month.  With that out of the way, I think I'd like to look in to buying a cheap ragwing tail dragger.  It looks like I can find them for around $15,000.  I'm considering Luscombe, Piper, Cessna, Citabria, etc.  It would be VFR only.  And its purpose would just be to have fun and build flight time.  The fuel prices at KSZP are currently $4.50 a gallon, which is what I'm paying for gas for my car.  The tie down fee is $35 a month.  Honestly I didnt know such a low price existed on tie downs anywhere in america.  I figure with the money saved on tie down, the typical annual will be almost paid for with the money saved on the tie down.

That would leave a gap for when I need a more capable airplane.  In those cases, I would just rent.  CP Aviation has 172's and a 182RG.

Was doing my low flying and terrain &amp; weather awareness flying earlier this week, in strong winds which is when we typically practice it. Great fun and incredible to see how tight you can turn when turning into wind compared to downwind.

Max AOB we're allowed during some of the maneuvers when that low to the ground and in the bad weather configuration - 2 stages flaps &amp; 75kts IAS, is 45 degrees. Doing these turns into wind and looking down at the ground, we're basically near 0-5kts GS and essentially turning on the spot, weird feeling and visual to have.

Am I right in saying, say our stall speed is 44kts in that configuration, with an AOB being 45 degrees and thus approx a 1.4G turn, our new stall speed would be  **√**1.4 x 44 =   52.06kts? And as long as you stay coordinated and above that stall speed (plus bit of a margin), it's pretty safe?

A Cessna/Piper with a 1:9 (or so) glide ratio, though? Could ridge lift be strong enough to prolong the inevitable and maybe give some extra time for trouble shooting or calling for help, or looking for a reasonable spot to land?

Let's say trimmed for best glide it travels at 65 knots, so that's around 110 feet per second. This means per second it sinks around 110/9 = 12 feet.

Wind blowing against the mountain can maybe generate 70% of that in vertical lift against the steeper parts of the mountain, but let's assume just 30% to give us some margin. If the wind is around 30 knots, that would result in about 10 knots of vertical component, or around 17 feet/second. More than the plane's 12 feet/second sink-speed.

Why not aim for and try to touch down near or beyond the threshold?

I'll confess why I ask: I trained for my PPL at at rural city in a western US state. I mean rural. I had to go to a Class C airport one state away for my checkride. On the first landing I landed maybe 250 feet beyond the threshold (well before the first ""piano key""). **The DPE ripped me a new one**, right then and there, and with flourish!! Had I not done so well on the rest of the checkride he would have failed me.

On another note, I wish there was a way for pilots to provide feedback on DPEs! I mean, we're under the microscope and the DPE is God on a check ride... Is there a way to rate DPEs to the FSDO without fear of retaliation? My checkride described above was shitty because of the attititude of the DPE. He could have used my mistake as a teaching moment in an entirely different way. Instead he carped about ""I'm so sick and tired of flying with pilots that have wallets thicker than their logbooks.""

I have a question,the first respond the pilots did when somethings goes wrong is ***pull up*** and ***retract the flaps***,so everyone think that is wrong because they were so **fatiue**,but what if they think in that time **tail stall** is happing and they are trying to recover the airplane from **tail stall?**

yeah tail stall is so hard to happend in the normal situation,but in this situation they know **they get ice** in the airplane,and in our flihgt training we learned **tail stall may occur in icing condition!**so did they really think that is a tail stall and try to **do the right thing** for **recovering from tail stall?**

**About wing stall and tail stall**:somebody says tail stall you can feel the **york shaking but not the airplane shaking**,so thats a problem,Colgan 3407 DASH-8 Q400,***one of the stall alert system is york shaking***!so we can image:icing condition,approaching,flaps down,york shaking,fatigue. and plus you just did some training for how to recovering for tail stall.  **WHAT WILL YOU DO？ The same as they do or?**",flying,1575426965,RichardQinUND,12,1,True,2019-12-03

144,BFR for foreign-based FAA license?,"Hi all,

Two years ago, a friend of mine obtained an FAA PPL based on a foreign license (Switzerland) through a California FSDO. He got a flight review in Switzerland a couple months ago, which extended his Swiss license validity for 2 more years. He is visiting the US this Christmas break and is planning to fly using his foreign-based FAA PPL. We are wondering whether he needs a BFR from an FAA CFI, despite his recent flight review in Switzerland.

My reading of [FAA Order 8900.1, Vol.5, Chapter 2, Section 14](http://fsims.faa.gov/PICDetail.aspx?docId=8900.1,Vol.5,Ch2,Sec14) makes me think he **does** need a BFR from a US CFI, but he thinks he doesn't because his US license is foreign-based and therefore not a *real* US FAA license. From what I understand, he does not even believe his FAA plastic card (which says PRIVATE PILOT (FOREIGN BASED) and has a certificate number) falls under the denomination ""US pilot certificate"" used in the FARs and FAA Orders. Is that even possible?

It seems like the FSDO employees are required to tell them about that, which I have no reason to believe they did not. In the document linked above I read the following:

&gt; ""Discuss Relevant Regulations with the Applicant. Advise the applicant about the rules and requirements contained in part 61 and in part 91 (e.g., flight review requirements, recency of experience requirements, and required logbook entries). As a point of emphasis, make clear to the applicant that a flight review (refer to § 61.56) must be administered by the holder of an FAA flight instructor certificate with the appropriate ratings before he or she may exercise the privileges of his or her U.S. pilot certificate. The proficiency checks administered by a foreign flight instructor do not count as meeting the flight review requirements of § 61.56.""

150,Holy crap flying is fun but the whole thing is intimidating,"Hello all,

I made another post wondering about structural failures in GA a few days before my first discovery flight. I tend to be a worrywart if that wasn’t made clear in my first post.

Well today was the special day and I went up in a 162 on a slightly windy day ~10 kts with gusting until we made it up above the clouds. Flying the airplane was really amazing and it was such a different experience than I’m used to when I fly RC models or on my desktop sim. My instructor, who was amazing, showed me some of the capabilities of the airplane pulling positive and negative Gs that put me a bit more at ease of what the plane can handle.

My biggest problem is that during the whole thing, even though I understand most of what’s going on (at a basic level from flight sim and RC), I had some trouble processing it all due to sheer amazement that I was actually living a childhood dream.

Something that was strange for me was the size of the panel. Since the 162 didn’t have adjustable seats, I couldn’t really see above the panel (I’m 5’6”) which made it hard to resist looking at the artificial horizon excessively. Also, the vibrations and being tossed around in the wind was expected but experiencing it was a bit intimidating. Lastly, I could hear atc just fine but between all that was going on, I missed so many instructions that were directed at us. Even though my instructor was handling all communications with atc, I still thought I’d be able to do better with that from years of listening to liveatc.

I was looking through the fractional companies' pages on airlinepilotcentral.com and I noticed that there are dozens of bases listed for NetJets and FlexJet and I just have a few questions about some information that I couldn't find or didn't see.

-Do you bid for one of these bases the same as an airline or is the process different for them? 
-Are you home based out of an airport or will you possibly begin each week at a different airport?
-Are pilots for these companies able to commute either via airline jumpseats/deadhead or via company planes?

I can't think of any more questions at the moment, I guess I'm just surprised to see so many bases listed for them after seeing the usual 5-10ish bases for airlines.

Is there anything else I can do before I start besides downloading the appropriate books to begin studying?

191,Well looks like I'm going to sell the Grumman and build an RV-8,"I've pretty much decided that I'm going to sell my '76 AA-5B and start building an RV-8.  It's to the point where I have already ordered the manual to build the -8 and also the toolbox and simulated airfoil practice kits.  My Christmas list consists of all of the tools required to build the practice kits.  I'm also going to order the cool lighted sign kit they just cam out with.  

""But deadstick\_it, you already own an airplane.  And a Grumman Tiger at that.""

Yeah well I have some pretty good reasons to justify doing this.  Of course, as with everything in aviation none of the reasons are to be better off financially because almost nothing in aviation is financially viable.  Well one reason kind of is.  So here we go.

First, the Tiger has an old engine.  Old enough that it would have scared most people away when I bought it.  It had just under 2100 hours when I bought it and it now is probably a little ever 2300 hours.  I know, I know, I should keep better tabs on that but have a pretty good feel for when I'm getting near that 50 hours for an oil change and I haven't gone over that yet.  So anyway, the engine is old and even though its still strong and the oil filter comes out clean it's still a thing on my mind.  Especially when I'm flying my boy around.  Getting an overhaul done will cost me a small fortune and I wouldn't be able to do it without a loan.  Owning the plane outright and avoiding loans is the only reason I've been able to afford having the plane in the first place.

Second, I don't have a certified GPS installed which is something I want to have before I start instrument training.  I don't want to get my ticket 100% by using VORs and ILS approaches and then get a GPS and learn on the fly.  Of course I would police myself to not do that without getting an instructor involved but I know how I am and I wouldn't learn it like I would if it was part of my initial training.  Once again the small fortune thing comes in to play with this.  It's to the point where I would have to choose between the engine or GPS.

Third, and probably the biggest motivator, my favorite A&amp;P ever is nearing retirement.  He is at the point where he has closed his shop and has taken another A&amp;P job where he can receive retirement benefits when the time comes.  There are a select few of us on the field who he will still take care of because we are good people and myself especially for a couple reasons.  He knows I can barely afford to keep my plane in the air and he has told me many times that he would rather keep the planes in the air instead of make a ton of money.  This has been indicated by the times where I know he has cut me some slack on the invoice for thins.  Also, he lets me do owner assisted maintenance so it doesn't really take up must of his time.  He knows I'm mechanically inclined and I follow procedures to a T so he has no problem letting me do the work and checking it.  I was the first person he has ever had approach him about doing that and he got lucky that I am competent enough to be safe doing it.  However, when he finally hangs it up there will be no A&amp;P on the field and I may have to fork over the cash to pay the full amount of an annual because I can't do an owner assist anymore.  This will cause huge issues for me keeping my plane in the air.

So here is the plan.  I'm about to get a tail beacon and install it.  I'll get my A&amp;P so inspect it and sign it off.  While I'm dealing with that I will discuss with him about my engine overhaul options for the Tiger.  Most likely I will pull the engine myself and we will ship it to get it worked.  I'll take a loan out on the 401K to make that happen.  While it is out I will get the annual done so that I will have a zero time engine and a fresh annual.  Then the Tiger will go on the market.  I have a good idea of what the plane will bring in and I will be able to pay the loan back once it is sold and also should have enough cash on hand to buy the engine for the -8.  With my regular pay and when I get overtime I'll be able to afford the different kits for the -8.  I'm still working on where to get the money for the avionics but since this will take years to complete I think by the time I need the avionics I'll have scraped the money up from somewhere.

The end result will be a zero time airplane that can cruise much faster than the Tiger and also can perform aerobatics.  Not only will it have a certified GPS but will also have an auto pilot which is another thing I want for instrument flying.  Since Ive been flying for some time now I have determined that a two seater is not really going to be that much of a problem for me.  I can count on one hand the number of times in the almost four years I've owned the Tiger that I needed more than two seats.  Weight and balance will probably be a factor more than it is now but that's something I can deal with.  I'm a little spoiled because I pretty much need need to figure W&amp;B because when you fly the same plane for four years you just know.  I did have all seats filled up once and you bet your ass I calculated W&amp;B for that one.

The truth is, since I've gotten into flying I have had this urge to build one.  Either an RV or a kitfox.  I can't shake it.  I made some repairs to my air filter box on the Tiger and needed to use clecos and smash some rivets to get it fixed and it was awesome.  I want to do more of that.  I want to roll out on to the runway and take off in an airplane that I assembled with my own hand to my exact specifications with regard to equipment and stuff.  I want to be able to do annuals and make repairs that I am fully capable of doing without having to open a fortune of having someone else do it.  Something dumb like bleeding brake lines is a joke but technically you're probably not supposed to do it if you aren't an A&amp;P.  Hell, I want to have a USB plug installed in the panel to charge my iPad without having to pay a shitload for a certified one and another shitload for having an A&amp;P put it in.

I'm thinking my mind is in the right place to undertake this.  I'm more excited about the journey than the destination.  What I mean by that is I'm more excited about building the plane than the end result of flying it.  I'm not even daydreaming about flying it.  I'm dreaming more of smashing rivets and fucking up parts and getting pissed off about it.  I'm really pumped about doing the avionics and wiring everything up.  I love doing that stuff.  I'll probably start a YouTube channel and document everything.  Hopefully it was get a small following that will keep me help accountable for staying on task with building but also for document the build and make it easy to show the FAA inspectors proof that I did most of the build.  If I do start that I'll let you guys know if you want to follow along.

So there ya go.  That's what my mind has been on with regard to flying for the last few months.  Not exactly sure of the point of this post but maybe for some encouragement or for somebody to slap me upside the face and tell me this is a stupid idea.  Oh well, this seems like when I went in to buy my first airplane.  You can never be sure if it will be a safe bet.

Cost of living seems almost the same if not actually a few hundred less in Miami for nicer apartments than SD we've vacationed there a few times and the beaches are way more gorgeous than San Diego, bahamas nearby, etc... it would just be a year lease and we could move back to SD if we ended up not liking it there.

Thus the nickname ""the unbeatable record"".

Earlier today, Bill Harrelson launched from St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL to beat the unbeatable record. Bill is not new to long-distance record flying; he holds two official world records already for ""Distance"" (from Guam to Jacksonville, Florida) and ""speed around the earth over both the earth's poles"" in the same class, flown in a heavily modified Lancair 4 (N6ZQ) which Bill and his wife Sue built specifically for long distance flights. It holds 361 gallons of fuel, to name just one of the many modifications.

As I am writing this,  Bill is on over Texas, his first of five planned legs, from Florida to Honolulu. After that he will go to Jakarta, Indonesia, then Cape Town, South Africa, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and back to Florida.

212,Why would you NOT go straight to the regionals ASAP,"TLDR: Due to the power of compounding interest and your personal financial risk tolerance/profile, it can make sense to delay starting your 121 airline career if in doing so you are able to invest a substantial chunk of money at a young age.


I want to address something You’ll hear almost daily in the community from a different perspective than usual. I hope this information can be helpful to someone that is in a unique situation like I am. What I’m talking about is the general sense of:

“don’t worry about your pay now! Just grind and get to regionals! You’ll be making $200k+ in 10 years so it doesn’t matter.”  

That so many people seem to take as gospel. I believe that while yes it is true to a good  extent. It can also (and has in the past) put people into some very bad financial situations (lost decade anyone?). I’m simplifying my points down to a purely financial/wealth building stand point. Max amount of money at retirement age for minimum risk is what we’re looking at. Leaving quality of life stuff out. I see 2 main issues everyone should address individually, or at least be aware of, that lots of people gloss over. These are the value of letting money compound for longer, and the chance of not having a “perfect” 121 career. A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.

First (and again this is VERY simplified but I find most young pilots I know hardly know what interest is)  is that with  a standard rate of return (7%) in the stock market you can expect your money to double roughly every 10 years. 100k year 1 being 200k year 10, 400k year 20, etc. because of this you really want as much money in that “retirement” account as possible as early as possible. Let’s take 2 situations. Jane and Alice. Both are 30 years old and have 1500hrs. 

Assume an ideal 35 year long airline career consisting of 3 years at regionals averaging 80k/yr, then 32 years at a major with typical pay scale and also accounting for 2% yearly inflation raise. I also assumed a (huge for most) 35% of salary a year into savings.  (BTW if you’re one of the riddle kids at delta at 26 good for you, this doesn’t apply, go blow it all on Tesla stock)

-Jane  goes straight to the regionals and starts her 121 career but has $0 in savings.

-Alice has a sweet gig making good $$ and is able to put “X” dollars into saving year 1 but must wait to start her 121 career til beginning of year 3. (2 years later than Alice)

How much money “X” does Alice have to invest up front in order to make up for those 2 lost 121 years?

The answer may surprise you! 

For my situation Alice’s number came out to around 100k.  But If anytime in that “perfect” 121 career just ONE year of major pay is cut out, that 100k up front starts to outperform by A LOT. Imo Alice is shielded better from risk since it’s a lot more likely she loses her medical, has to take a year off, or is furloughed (go read “hard landing” ) than the US stock market stagnating for 35 years.

It’s pretty easy to setup this all in excel (or make you math friend) and play around with different variable like savings rates, return rates, years, etc but the conclusion is it can defiantly make sense to delay your airline career a few years if you land a great gig that’s paying you double a regional salary. 

As always YMMV and it comes down to your individual situation.",flying,1575610836,Apgilles,41,1,True,2019-12-06

219,Part 91 turbine SIC or CFI?,"Hey all, I’m hoping to get some opinions on two potential routes I can go in my career:

Some background: I just finished the ATP flight school program through MEI but there are currently no CFI openings at any locations I can reasonably accept (I’m tied to SoCal because of my wife’s career). My ultimate goal is to gain my 1500 hours and transition into the airlines. 

I have a potential opportunity to fly SIC on a CJ IV from my local airport but it would only be flying around 30 hours a month. Unfortunately those hours are spread over several 3-5 day trips so I would not be able to instruct with ATP on the side as I originally hoped. 

My main concern is that only getting 30 hours a month would push back my target date for 1500 hours at least 3 years (compared to instructing with ATP).

Basically, I see two potential options (if you can think of other options, I’m all ears)
1) Take the CJ SIC job and hopefully still instruct through a different, more flexible flight school or flying club. Or...
2) Wait for a CFI opportunity at an ATP location within a reasonable distance of me and take that as my full-time source of hours. 

Specifically, I’d like some insight on how feasible you all think the first option of those two is and realistically how many extra hours a month I could expect as a CFI on the side. Also, how important really are the regional partnerships with flight schools like ATP vs coming out of another school/flight club without any partnerships? And finally, how useful will those 400-500 turbine hours be on an application to the regionals?

220,Confused about Cessna 172SP Startup Checklist,"I mostly fly Pipers at my club but I'm putting the checklists into foreflight for our other planes, so when I do get checked out in them i'll have the checklist ready and understand the procedures. This Cessna 172SP checklist has me a little confused and I know you guys can explain it better. Here's how it's printed in the POH:

ENGINE START (WITH BATTERY)

1) THROTTLE - OPEN 1/4""

2) MIXTURE - IDLE CUTOFF

3) PROPELLER AREA - CLEAR

4) MASTER SWITCH - ON

5) BEACON - ON

&amp;#x200B;

IF ENGINE IS WARM, OMIT PRIMING STEPS 6-11

6) THROTTLE - FULL

7) FUEL PUMP - ON

8) MIXTURE - FULL RICH UNTIL FUEL FLOW STABLE (3-5 SEC)

9) MIXTURE IDLE CUTOFF

10) FUEL PUMP - OFF

11) THROTTLE - OPEN 1/4""

12) MAGNETOS - START, RELEASE WHEN ENGINE STARTS

13) MIXTURE - ADVANCE TO RICH WHEN ENGINE STARTS

&amp;#x200B;

WHEN ENGINE STARTS

14) FUEL PUMP - OFF

15) AVIONICS - ON

16) other stuff

&amp;#x200B;

My first question is in regards to the wording ""If engine is warm, omit priming steps 6-11"", does that mean these are the steps for a hot start? and not to prime the engine during steps 6-11? OR are these the steps for a cold start, and it's saying if the engine is warm you skip steps 6-11? If the latter, then it's weird because you'd follow steps 1-5, which doesn't entail turning on the fuel pump, but step 14 has you turning it off once engine starts.

Next question in regards to steps 6-11. The whole thing is confusing to me. What is happening when you turn the Fuel Pump On, putting the mixture rich for 3-5 seconds, taking the mixture out, and then turning the fuel pump back off? And why do you start the process with throttle full, only to take it back to 1/4"" after you do all of that with the mixture? I have a suspicion it has to do with being fuel injected?",flying,1575642694,ZombieDust33,50,1,True,2019-12-06

Specifically a bush pilot, I dont have much money to my name at all and would most likely have to take a loan of some sort.

1. I live in Missouri, should i start by getting my ppl here in state? or would it be beneficial to move elsewhere and go all in on getting both my commercial and private? 

2. (this is more an extension of number 1) if you would recommend leaving MO, would the best option be to just go straight to AK? If so are there any pilot schools you would recommend?

3. Is this even attainable? My family is poor and i will be on my own through this. With the only upside being that i am single and 21. But i am willing to dedicate 100% because at this point in my life i am going nowhere. 

4. A big reason i want to go for bush piloting as opposed to airline is that i do not have the resources to get a degree, nor do i have the desire to be an airline pilot. (this isnt the only reason I want to be in the bush, but one of many)  Would you recommend any other piloting jobs outside of the bush that may be more efficient to work towards?

248,Just passed my EASA CPL checkride!,"I just passed my EASA CPL skill test in Czech Republic. It went smooth, the examiner was very kind, and I suppose that he really wanted me to pass. Fortunately the weather cooperated too: chilly, a little hazy, but no clouds and no gusts.

In Europe it's mandatory to fly a complex airplane during commercial checkride, so we had the school's cessna 172RG cutlass with a cool callsign OK-CPL.

There was an oral part and a flying part. European oral part is much easier than American, probably because the written exams in Europe were a nightmare compared to FAA's. Some questions about M&amp;B, airplane systems, route planning, airspaces, transponder modes, weather reports and forecasts, flight planning (fuel, performance).

Flying part was easier than the US in terms of commercial maneuvers: no lazy 8's, no chandelles, no power-on stalls, no steep spirals, no eights on pylons. Just steep turns, power-off stalls, spiral dive recovery (unusual attitudes), and a slow flight. No power-off 180, but an en-route engine failure instead.

As in the US, we had some diversion with a quick mental calculation of time, fuel, distance and heading. I did not know in advance at which part of our route it would happen. And, of course, different kind of landings (normal, no flaps, short field). 

Compared to the FAA checkride, there was additionally en-route engine failure (approach to the nearest suitable field), en-route engine failure when there is some aerodrome in gliding distance (but you don't know which one in advance), en-route precaution landing, and radial tracking. It was also some more challenging navigation (also without GPS): entering to the CTR and proceeding to visual waypoints (they're on the map, and additionally described in the AIP - for example, 'lonely fuel station' or 'railway bridge'). I also had to fill my navlog on the significant points and report entering/crossing/leaving ATZ (there is no such thing in the US around uncontrolled aerodromes).

The flying part took 2 hours (to be pedantic, 1 hour 59 minutes). And I passed!

Post is accurate, I've seen it face-to-face. Pretend in this hypothetical appraisal that it's at your home airport, so there's no relocation costs etc. Same owner since 2003, about 800 hours since then. Some other facts to consider in your appraisal:   


The good: it's a currently airworthy, working Cherokee 180 for less than $30k. Already at my home field so acquisition / rehoming costs are nil.

The bad: it's got a rough paint job - no shine left, starting to crack at leading edges etc. and rust marks around screws.Crash in 1991 that ripped the NLG off, included a prop strike, and included reskinning the right wing and aileron. Not yet ADS-B compliant.  


Some contemporaneous notes I took when talking to the owner about a prebuy that did not result in a sale the other week:

Mattituck overhaul 1994  
Squawk concerns:  
Alternator never been changed since 2003 - corroded (will be dealt with by owner)  
Trim line cable is kinked (will be dealt with by owner)  
Fuel line corrosion on interfaces between fuel line and other pipes  
some corrosion on valve covers  
corrosion on wheel struts, some pitting  
corrosion on spark plugs  
baggage door gasket

I live out in the country, so hours come slowly and I only have 2 students that maybe fly twice a week if I’m lucky.

Additionally, I’d be really interested in negotiating with the seller on maybe updating the interior and/or avionics for the sale, I’d at least like new seats and something like a Garmin 530 or 750, as well as re manufactured engines if the ones on the aircraft for sale aren’t in good shape. I really have no experience with the used aircraft market, so any help would be appreciated! At the most, I’m willing to spend $25,000 but even that is pushing it for me.

343,"IFR Finally ""Clicked""","I've been flying IFR since I started training for it about 14 months ago.  I got my rating 6 months ago.  I feel like it finally clicked... yesterday.

I went up to play in the cumulous layers left behind a cold front that had just come through the SFO area.  Ceilings were easy at 2k, but tops were up around 6-7k so I'd get plenty of actual IMC time.

After about 15 minutes of actual, something changed.  It was like my subconscious mind suddenly took over the scan, freeing up my conscious mind to worry about everything else.  As I popped in and out of clouds, I realized that entering IMC was stress free for the first time ever.  Transitioning to instruments felt like a complete non-event.  As a result, I got way ahead of the plane.  I did 3 back to back approaches, and actually felt like I had time to relax in between them!  I was also flying more smoothly, as it's so much easier to avoid over-controling when you're relaxed.

In PPL training, you start out super focussed on the sight picture, using tons of concentration to keep the nose where it should be on the horizon.  Later, this becomes completely subconscious, and you don't even realize the tiny corrections you're making all the time.  Yesterday was like that, except IFR.  My brain just didn't care at all whether the attitude info was coming from the real horizon or the AI.

So, to all my fellow aviators starting out with IFR who feel totally overwhelmed by maintaining the scan while staying ahead, it does get easier!  It just may take a while :)",flying,1575911538,zaruthoj,52,1,True,2019-12-09

I know I'm not the only pilot to have these questions, emotions and worries, but it apparently isn't something that my friends in the industry can relate to. I'd love to hear your perspective on these thoughts. 

The first and worst issue for me is imposter syndrome. The responsibility of this job weighs heavy on me, despite having gone through all the training, passed the sims, getting praised by captains, etc. No matter how much I learn, how much I fly or how many times I pass training with no problems, the pressure of the job makes me anxious. I understand a little bit of this keeps you from getting complacent and makes you objectively a better pilot; however, I can't help but feel it's taking a toll on my happiness. I have a very hard time putting it aside during my days off or time at the hotel. Studying and feeling confident in aircraft knowledge/procedures helps, but it seems that without literally living in the books 24/7, I'm simply unable to retain all the information and it is a hit to my confidence.

Another underlying anxiety I have related to this career is how delicate it is; my entire livelihood will be riding on so many fragile factors. Of course, there is the question of what to do if you suddenly lose your medical. I understand thinking about this all the time is a waste of energy, as you either have the medical or don't; however, it is a reality of this career. Do most pilots have back up plans? I don't have a degree to fall back on. I wouldn't be opposed to going back to school if need be but it is obviously a major life event and will change the entire course of a person's life. 

Pilots are not perfect; they make mistakes, and the thought of having your license/career taken away over a mistake is scary. Unlikely and would have to be something major, but possible and scary. I hear all the time that ""nobody is ready to be a captain until they're in the left seat with an FO next to them"", and I realize there is always more time to learn and train. I realize you're never required to upgrade unless you feel ready. However, this still weighs heavy on me. Maybe I hold myself to a high standard, but when I make silly mistakes despite my best efforts, my confidence takes another hit. I've performed very well throughout my training and career to this point, but still wonder if I am physically able to focus enough to captain a large aircraft safely and confidently. 

I see captains make mistakes where, if I were in their shoes, I would be saying to myself ""you're a captain, and you can't be making mistakes like this"". Again, I recognize pilots DO make errors and the crew is supposed to catch the mistakes of the coworkers, but I don't see how to gain such confidence despite these errors. Sim is an entirely different world from real flying and I'm not convinced I would perform as well in a real emergency scenario.

Apologies for the wall of text. I'm sure these feeling are much more common than I can see, but I'm curious how you all feel about this. 

TL,DR: At the airlines now and having trouble dealing with and accepting the responsibility of this career. Trying to figure out if this career will ultimately leave me unhappy.",flying,1575918126,ComplicitPotato,58,1,True,2019-12-09

If you go to the flight plan page, select the menu key, and scroll down, you'll find the ""Closest Point of FPL"" option.

367,I added up everything for my PPL,"I finally went back and organized my finances a little bit, rectified my logbook, and broke down what it took to get my PPL. None of this is special, rare, or particularly interesting, but it might be another useful data point for someone, since this question comes up a lot, so here's what it took for me to go from discovery flight to shaking hands with a DPE:  


**1 year, 1 month, and 3 weeks.**  
This is about twice as long as I had hoped it would take, but it turned out just not to be very feasible (mostly financially, but also schedule-wise) for me to fly more than once a week, 1-3 hours at a time. I was also all but grounded for 3-4 months from soloing because my first attempt at a medical required jumping through some hoops. *Get your medical immediately* once you decide you're going forward with this!  


**53.2 total hours. 13.2 hours solo. Soloed at 35.5 hours. Had 46.7 hours in Cessna 172 and 6.5 in a Cessna 152.**  
I'm pretty happy with how that all turned out. I expected to finish in about 60 hours so beating that by a bit was a good feeling. However, once I started really training, I realized that I mostly didn't care how quickly I was moving through it. Other than where you can go and with who, *training is flying* and I found I was always happy to be doing it. I had considered going sport pilot but quickly realized that the increased training would not only open up more opportunities for me, but also make me a better and safer pilot overall. Similarly, when I soloed wasn't very important to me, but I included it here because someone will probably ask.  
These times include the checkride itself.  


**Total cost: $14,790**  
That's all-in, from the first discovery flight to the DPE's fee itself... it excludes only the cost of various peripherals like books (probably $50 total), ForeFlight subscription (I did this about 30 hours in, hardly required though), and the iPad Mini I had to buy to run it. I guess if I was being completely thorough I'd include the gas money I spent getting to and from the field, but I'm not gonna add that up. This is in Los Angeles (based at KTOA), which is not a cheap place to do much of anything. I could have saved probably almost $2000 if I had done all of the training in the 152, but I just didn't like it very much so I used it only when necessary.

And the US institutions seem to be out of the question as well, since the few who offer flight training loans are geared towards US schools. 

The relatively affordable cost of flight training in Canada is the most appealing aspect of it, but it seems like the biggest barrier to entry is needing the money upfront. So, other than having a rich uncle, is there any way for me to finance training?

383,Tropical Island FAA PPL cost,"I did my PPL in Guam. Why Guam? Well I live in Japan and that is the closest place for me to get an FAA PPL. Plus the idea of doing it at a tropical island appealed to me. More on why I don't recommend this later in the thread. 

**Total Time 8 months and 56:24 flight hours:** This is from the discovery flight until the DPE handed me my TAC. Solo'd at just shy of 20 hours

**Total Cost 17,766:** Airplane usage ($165 per hour for 172) $9306, Instructor fees ($50 per hour) $2220, First Class Medical $175, Travel to Guam (4 trips @ $600) $2400, Hotel fees (21 nights @ $65) $1365, Car Rental Fees (4 times @$300) $1200, DPE fees $1100.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts now that it is complete. I would not recommend doing your PPL in Guam unless you live there and going to the mainland is not feasible. 

Originally I thought that the location being only a 4 hour flight would be more convenient and cost efficient. I also thought I would be able to get it done in closer to 40 hours (foolish I know) and that was my justification to paying the much higher hourly rental fee for a very very used 172. Also I thought the idea of flying over tropical islands for a cross country sounded sexier than cow towns in BFE. 

Here's what actually happened. The flight school I attended only had 1 CFI and he was not living in Guam and therefore not always on the island. So I had to plan my life and training around his availability while juggling my work schedule and life in Japan. Maintenance wasn't always done on the aircraft and as such the 2 - 172's they had usually had issues. Also only one of them could be used for training. The other was only for doing sightseeing flights for customers and you guessed it, when the customer plane was down the training one was used for customer flights and training had to wait. Another issue I had was that even though I paid for all of my training materials (flight computer, jeppesen books, plotter, maps, AFD, etc) I did not get them until the day before I was scheduled to take the written exam. This means I had purchased all of these materials myself from another source when I returned to Japan. When I asked why they had not been given to me earlier the owner said 'sorry' and that was all. This was of course the cheapest (you get what you pay for) school on the island and I am sure the others are better but they quoted me 20K price just to get to 40 hours. So If I had gone to 56 hours with them the PPL would have been close to 30K at the other schools. And then DPE's are not always available so you have to wait until there are enough people ready for checkrides on the island before one will come. Since his schedule is packed I had one chance and once chance only to pass my checkride on that visit (he may not be back for another year) and to add to the frustration the training aircraft had a magneto issue that rendered it a paperweight. This issue was discovered the evening before my checkride but the A&amp;P had not gotten around to fixing it by the time my checkride was scheduled. This meant that the DPE and I sat around talking for 4 hours while 5 different mechanics were trying to get it serviceable. In the end it barely passed the MAG check and I was able to go but the DPE was none to happy with having to wait around. 

Now the sexy thing about island hopping cross country flights is the dangerous thing about them... it's just you, the big blue, and one very freaking old plane and one very well used engine. So the X-C flight in Guam is from PGUM to PGSN with a stop at PGRO which is a straight line distance of 112nm. However there is a TFR and we have to fly around it so it usually ends of being 125 nm each way, with the longest open water expanse being 63nm. So assuming a no wind situation the 172 is about a 1.5 nm per 1000 ft glider. So even if you could somehow get to 12,500 ft you could only glide almost 18.75 nm. This means there is a 25 nm distance where you are definitely ditching in the ocean if there is a problem. Realistically though you are not at 12,500 but 9,500 and 8,500 which means a 35 to 38 nm stretch where you are in trouble. Also when crossing the ocean obviously you are taking a life raft and life vests with you but your chances of surviving are slim to none ditching in a 172 in the ocean. I mean you have to get unbelted, the door may or may not be easy to get out of and then you have to get the life raft out and clear of the plane somehow. Another thing is that there is no VOR except for at Guam so there is nothing to track when going to PGSN, but even if there was the aircrafts VOR system was INOP. This means you fly these X-C's via DR. Also the night flight is the same except the old plane has no panel lights which means you have to fly while holding a red flashlight in one hand and moving it in front of the gauges. To add more challenge the DI processed about 15 degrees every 4 to 5 minutes, so you are basically compass flying a heading and trying to hold a heading. Again being a tropical location there are no such things as cloudless days or windless days. Every landing is a crosswind landing (16 to 20 knot gusts) meaning that except for early morning flights you rarely used flaps. Also I had to make this trip 4 times (1 day and 1 night with instructor, and then 2 times solo) and what I learned is that it is super boring as it is 3.5 hours staring at nothing...even worse when solo because there is no conversation. I have the lightspeed bluetooth headset but ATC means constant cuts to the music and therefore it was more annoying than anything. And then the icing on the cake is that PGRO and PGSN are international flights so I had to get my radio license which isn't a problem but it also means you can not full stop land without having an international flight plan and going through customs so in short you can not go to the bathroom until you get back to PGUM. 

  
So I highly recommend going to a mainland located reputable school with more than 1 full time instructor and more than 1 plane if possible. Also stay over land as most training airplanes are very old and if something goes wrong your chances of surviving a forced landing in a pasture is much greater than in the ocean. Finally there is more to see and the flights will be more interesting. My instructor was great and I think that if not for his help I would not have been able to finish in 56 hours. In conclusion PPL training in Guam is not a good idea. Cheers and hope this helps someone.",flying,1575963180,JacqueRoberts,57,1,True,2019-12-10

388,Williams FJ33-5A I modeled/3D printed for my dad,"When my dad and I take people in the SF-50 for the first time, eventually someone will ask ""How does a jet engine work?"" We often struggle to explain, using hasty and poorly-drawn diagrams. So, I decided for Christmas to model/3D print the engine on our plane. There’s not a lot of information available on the FJ33, but I was able to piece together what I felt was a pretty close representation of how the engine works. I will admit that I took some “artistic license” when it came to filling in the gaps, but at the end of the day, I think it turned out pretty nice.

Although the whole assembly spins (and admittedly, my tolerances were a bit tight so it doesn't spin freely), in reality the N1 and N2 shaft spin at different RPM's. In this model, I wasn't about to try and figure out how to do that so they just spin at the same RPM.

The assembled model is just over 50cm long. For those of you that also enjoy the hobby of 3D printing, it was printed entirely on a Prusa i3 MK3S, using a hodgepodge of both PLA and ColorFabb nGen filament (just depending on what I had laying around). Layer height for almost all the parts was .15mm. I have no idea how long this took to print because several of the parts had multiple iterations. True-to-form, though, the i3 handled remarkably well, and outside of some design issues, I had zero failed prints. The printer has been chugging out parts since late October.

391,Options for my first plane,"I'm looking from some advice from experienced aircraft owners.

Quick background: I'm a low time private pilot (checkride 2/17) with a tail wheel sign off (12/19).

I'm ready to buy my first plane.  I've searched all the normal websites for what planes are available and the average costs.  I feel that a Cherokee 140, 180, or Arrow would fit my mission very well.  I'm stuck between 2 thought processes.

1) I can buy a Cherokee 140/180 for 25-35K cash and still have money left in savings for issues that come up.  I'd probably keep it for a few years and upgrade.

2) I can get a loan and buy a Arrow for up to 60K (10K down, 50K financed) which would leave me enough money for issues as well.  I think that an arrow is the type of plane that I would upgrade to anyway so why not just start with it.  With other hobbies, I usually buy the equipment that is an intermediate or advanced level and skip the beginner equipment because it's usually just too beginner.  I don't know if that logic will apply to planes but it seems to apply to me personally.

I want to use my money efficiently and I can see pros and cons to both options.  Has anyone else gone through something similar?  Please let me know your experiences.",flying,1575991038,TheCarefulBurn,44,1,True,2019-12-10

(Note: The Stealth 2 ANR is the new Oct 2019 model sold exclusively by Sporty's, not the older v1).  


Keeping in mind...  
**Faro Stealth 2 ANR = $450**  
**Bose A20 = $1000**  


I would prefer to keep out speculation and have those who have actually used both objectively comment on each. Why is the Bose A20 worth $500 more? Or, why is it not? I'm very interested to know where they overlap and where they diverge in terms of quality and performance. Both feature active noise reduction (ANR) and Bluetooth (BT) wireless for mobile / music / alerts. The A20's are great, no doubt, but... is it possible we're paying $500 more for the Bose name?  


**Item suggestions to compare and comment about:**  
Intercom &amp; mic sound quality:   
Music sound quality via BT / Aux cable (not through intercom):   
Passive noise reduction quality (aircraft type?):  
Active noise reduction quality (aircraft type?):  
Battery life (AAx2) (aircraft type?):  
Construction quality / materials / durability:  
Reliability:  


**Side question for the pilot-audiophiles out there: music quality (via BT/aux) of high-end aviation headset (e.g. Bose A20 or Lightspeed S/T/Z)  vs.  quality home/studio Headphones (e.g. Sennheiser, Audiotechnica, Bose):**  
For those that have used a Bose / Lightspeed for music via BT / aux (not through intercom)... how do they sound compared to a normal (good) pair of at-home headphones that are similarly priced? A pair of Audio-Technica M50x's cost $150 and they are standard kit in every studio (less the mic). The soundscape in a cockpit is very different than a studio... understood.  
The question is about sound quality and speaker response:  does your music sound great with punchy lows and crisp highs through your A20 or LZ? Or does your music still sound like it's coming through a radio headset (no bass response, airy mids, and tinny highs?)

As a child, I think I was diagnosed with anxiety (and possibly depression too, I can’t remember).  I saw a psychologist, followed by a psychiatrist who put me on Prozac.  I took that for several years, probably up until sometime in high school.  I’m not exactly sure when I got off of it because at some point I just sort of...stopped taking it.  I think eventually it got taken off my prescription list because I don’t see it there anymore.  I didn’t have any adverse effects when I stopped taking it, nor have I had any issues since (I’m almost 25 now so it’s probably been almost a decade).  
 
I did see a therapist a few times last year, but it was to address depression related to a very specific event (got my heart a little broken but I’ve been over it for a while now).  To my knowledge, I wasn’t diagnosed with anything.

Visibility in Sydney has been very poor, pretty much has been well below the legal limit for nearly a month.

461,"I (tailwheel pilot from day one) tried a nosewheel for the first time. Chaos and humiliation ensued, AMA","I finally  figured out how to wedge my abnormally long torso and comically short legs into a 172 in such a way that I could manage the rudders and the yoke at the same time. (Read: after 10 weeks of ""my"" plane being in MX, I was a desperate, thirsty pilot.) I was ready to be blown away by Cessna magic! Let the love affair begin! I was told even a non-pilot could fly this baby like a pro. The disco flight over the weekend had landed on their first day (they bounced a lot, but...) How hard could it be if they'd done that? I was a *real* pilot. This was gunna go like whipped butter over hot toast.

Ha ha. Nope.

Preflight: I'm sure that there a lot of different dash layouts out there, but I didn't care for this one. The ASI was behind the yoke, right under my left hand. I NEED THAT ON TAKEOFF YO. Can't we put something more useless down there. Like the VSI? Or the oil gauges. You know, something you just don't need to look at often? Also, buttons. Buttons everywhere. Buttons on my side, buttons under the CFI's nose, buttons clear across the cabin, buttons. If I never see another button in a cockpit, I may still have random panic attacks about trying to find the pitot heat.

Taxiing: The yoke has a lot of play in it. I couldn't figure out where to put the elevator or the ailerons, or if what I was doing was counteracting the wind. The brakes are entirely too effective, and I felt like a two-footed driver in an automatic car. Lurch-thump-lurch-thump-lurch-halt-wince-lurch. I also overturned and turned too soon. 

Takeoff: I literally have no idea how you all get a feel for rotation. Here was my conversation with the plane:

""Ya wanna go buddy?""  
""Nah, imma lurch down the runway some more.""   
*give it some more elevator*    
*nothing*  
CFI: ""So, are you going to, maybe, perhaps, fly at any point?""  
*yank!*  

It doesn't tell you it wants to fly. As far as I can tell, this thing will gleeful cruise down the runway at 85mph without giving the slightest indication you can rotate. I'm used to being in a tailwheel, and if you don't tell it to rotate, don't worry, it will get the notion all by itself. 

So, summary -- One little 172 used up 95% of a mile long runway, but moving on here.

Flight: This is clearly where the 172 shines. It cruises through light bumps, it doesn't fight you at all when you choose an attitude. It settles down right away. I've never had this good of altitude control ever, and I've had some good flights in the Champ. I don't love the trim wheel's location or feel, but I do love the level of nuance in your trim that it allows for. I could REALLY dial it in. In comparision, the trim on a Champ is sort of rough and hard to get just so. It was delightful to just be a slow-moving buoyant marshmallow of a plane, looking down at Christmas lights. (Oh yes, this idiot decided to do a NIGHT FLIGHT in an unfamiliar plane. Because I'm a masochist and a glutton for outlandish punishments.) 

I did love the ease of doing simple turns, and how elegantly it handled even a steeper turn. I was not prepared, however, to have no way of doing a maneuver that is really easy in a tailwheel, wherein you drop a wing, but maintain your heading so you can see what's below you. Oh no, the 172 turned it into the cutest, neatest little turn. ""Are we going somewhere?"" Eurgh! I ended up doing a major slip so we could see the big downtown Christmas display. Which isn't super kosher, but no one else was up there....

Landing: I had a feeling this wasn't going to be rainbows and unicorns after the takeoff (I didn't really like the plane's takeoff attitude. The nose was just so big and out there and up, and stuff.) I lost sight of the end of the runway on my first attempt, sank too low, and left the pattern. I renentered the pattern, liked what I saw a lot better, and got very confused by the lack of trim setting on landing. I'm used to throwing it all the way back. The CFI added flaps as we'd discussed, but instantly the plane went into that unnerving attitude, and I decided that the flaps needed to go, right then and there. I accidentally extended my downwind, and then pulled the classic ""Stupid Night Mistake"" of accidentally lining up the taxiway, not the runway, and ended up having to do a very ugly final-base-cankle-combo thing to get to my runway but still came in grossly low. 

Whereupon, I found the Cessna is just as happy to not land as it is to not take off. I landed at 2200 feet in, desperately pulling power and discovering that all that play in the elevator that I'd discovered earlier meant I had no idea if I was pulling back enough. The landing was very soft. I didn't even realize it had happened it was so soft. The sight picture was just straight up weird. I felt like I was flaring underneath the earth, or somehow having perfect altitude control 1ft above the runway.  In a tailwheel you fly away from the runway, but slower than it is coming towards you. I felt with the cessna I had to fly INTO the runway, and that was exceedingly stressful.

But it basically stayed on centerline all by itself. I could get used to that.

Moral of the story: however terrified you are of trying tailwheel and looking like a fool, know that tailwheel-only guys are just as awful in a nosewheel.",flying,1576084303,Peliquin,109,1,True,2019-12-11

465,Career Change - Unsure if I Like to Fly...,"Hello everyone! I’ve seen posts on here touching this but everyone has a unique situation and, if you have a minute, I’d appreciate any advice!

Quick bit about me: 

I am 32 years old and recently left my I.T. career (seen posts on this but it wasn’t a crazy high paying job like the others!) after doing it for 12 years, burnt out after 6, and zero passion for it. Did it to pay the bills. Now my wife has a good job with good pay, we have money saved up, and now I have a chance to figure out what I want to do. I am very fortunate for this opportunity! 

My first try at finding a new career is learning to fly to become a pilot. I never even thought about it before but learned more from friends and family and decided to look into it further. I never had an interest or passion for flying previously. I took a discovery lesson which seemed cool then signed up for some classes. I am picking it up well and making great progress. I’ve been reading, studying, and watching tons of YouTube videos on flying. This process and challenge of it is super interesting to me. I also like the variety of job opportunities for commercial pilots and potentially even the idea of going airline. I just had my medical yesterday and passed it with flying colors, hearing multiple times ‘better than most.” 

Then I took a break from the constant aviation immersion and thought, do I even like flying?

I feel a bit guilty that I have yet to feel that spark when flying. It honestly feels like driving (obviously more complicated than that) in the air to me with nice views. We’ve done a few stalls and deep turns and hit some good turbulence. I HATE the feeling of roller coasters and it reminds me of that. I know the feelings will get worse as I continue. Completing a new maneuver or task is rewarding but I don't look forward to the rest of the actual flying process. 

I am in love with the process and challenges but don’t seem to have any passion for it. My concern is that I get my certs, fly for a few years, and am back to where I was with I.T. 

My questions to the group:

Has anyone felt like this starting out their career as a pilot? 

Do you eventually get that spark or reward even if it isn’t there yet? Or, is it how it seems where everyone had a passion and love for it going in to begin with? 

Also, if anyone has felt this way or know of anyone who has, what other fields/careers fill the process/challenge aspects of becoming a pilot?

473,Need help deciding between aviation degree or other degree,"Background: I am a senior in high school from California and will be getting my private pilots license this summer. My father went to Fresno State University for the ROTC program, but it ended up closing his junior year. So he got his degree in Liberal Arts, went home and got his ratings as soon as possible. He says he got hired three months after a good friend of his and that those three months of seniority have meant everything in his career from when he was furloughed (9/11) to what plane he is flying now. My grandfather flew for the air force in Vietnam and later became a commercial pilot as well. I would also like to play club baseball (not NCAA) at whatever college I go to. 

There are two routes I am stuck between. Either going to college to study what I’d like to study and then taking flight school after, or going to a college with an aviation program and getting hired by an airline as soon as possible. Getting the full college experience is something that is big to me as well. 

If I were to go along the study what I want route, I would likely study astronomy and I have three colleges in mind: San Diego State University, University of Utah, and University of Colorado at Boulder. I would get my degree, then go back home to get my ratings and instruct for a few years before getting hired. As you probably know, this would set me back 2-3 years and my father says it’d be giving up a lot of money and seniority in whatever airline hires me. 

If I choose to get an aviation major and fly in college, I’d probably be going to Utah State University. I looked at ASU, Montana State University, North Dakota University, and Embry-Riddle, but USU is the only college that truly interested me (plus I can get instate tuition really easily). I feel like going this route won’t allow me to get the full college experience that I’m looking for despite those extra couple of years of seniority that I’d be gaining. 

Don’t get me wrong, I want to fly, but I’m not sure if I want my flying to be my college. Plus, astronomy has been something I’ve been interested in since a young age and I’ve wanted to study it in college for years now. Does anyone have any insight on how seniority will effect me?

I am about to graduate college with an associates degree in 2 days. I’ve also been in the Army Reserves for 3 years and have 3 years remaining on my contract. I’ve been working on a cattle farm for over a year and can continue working there until mid January. I was really hoping to get into ATP near where I live in Louisville, KY, but I got turned down for a $90,000 loan from both Wells Fargo and Sallie Mae. I may be able to qualify for 2 separate loans, but I’m unsure if that is a good idea. Now I’m trying to weigh my options on where to go next.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. Her father has been flying corporate out of an airport near Louisville for around 25 years. He is pretty close with everyone at the airport, including the owner. He says he may be able to get me a job working the line at that airport. He also said that in the past, the owner has been known to reduce the price or even pay for exceptional workers flight training. Now there are no line workers that are seeking flight training so I could be the only one.

I’m unsure if I should work there full time or part time. Work there full time and save up to train all at once? Or train as I’m working? I don’t know which one would be most effective for getting training. I will have very little living expenses for the time being. I have a little under $10,000 saved, but that will soon be a lot less from paying tuition and buying a car since mine is almost kaput.

486,Is my flight school trying to commit tax evasion?,"So I recently switched flight schools. There was nothing wrong with my last one, it was a really great school. But I wanted to try and fast track my commercial so I decided to go to college.

BIG MISTAKE.

I got my PPL in August and I've gotten about 10 hours in since then. The program isn't government subsidized like many other programs in my area, but since money wasn't an issue and this program is only 2 years, I decided to go there.  Why have I gotten so few flights you may ask?

A number of reasons. The CFI, General Manager, Head of Maintenance, a handful of instructors and the scheduling coordinator have all quit within the last month and a half. The fleet of this flight school includes 3 or 4 beautiful Katanas (which only the liscensed students may fly, many of my peers are not liscensed yet) and some of the most run down 172Ms you'll ever see in your life. As of now there is only 1 plane that is considered airworthy.

From what I've heard (and this could just be rumors) the school also is in debt about $175 000 to the airport in landing fees. The instructors are rather liberal with information and most of them seem to accept that the school is a sinking ship.

Anyways, I had a flight there recently (my first in 6 weeks) and when it came time to pay at dispatch they were scratching their heads because they didn't have a debit machine. It was later in the day as I'm working on my night rating, so it was just the one dispatcher and a few instructors. They told me to just leave the balance and someone would sort it out eventually. Works for me.

I get a phone call a few days later. ""This is flight school dispatch, we're just calling to remind you of that balance you owe."" I say to them I says ""Do you have a machine now?"" They says ""Nope. But we will accept cash or e-transfer.""

....

Well now I'd really rather not thanks.

The only thing I've learned in college so far is that you don't need college, as it's really about your hours and experience and the pilot shortage is to my benefit. I will most likely return to my home airport in the future (I'm sort of stuck where I am right now due to social and work related reasons) but in the meantime what should I do?

The college refuses to do anything about it. I don't know the specifics but the flight school has some sort of contract with them. We've (my classmates and I) complained numerous times to our program coordinator, but we're always met with the same response.

490,Need Advice,"Well, let's get started then.

I am an Indian who finished high school in March and later applied for [Indigo Cadet Program - FTA](http://www.flyfta.com/pilot-training/indigo-cadet-program)

Basically, there are 3 parts in the entrance exam - 1. Written test 2. Aptitude test 3. Group discussion and Interview.

I gave first 2 on 9th and failed the aptitude test. The joystick was too sensitive for me and I got low scores in Joystick related tasks. I also got average scores on Multi tasking test which wasn't acceptable.

I was given a 6 month cool off period - I won't be able to apply for any Indigo Cadet Programs for 6 months. The examiner was pretty nice and he told me to practice joystick and multi task during these 6 months and then appear for the exam again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I can do that but I don't want to waste 6 month doing just that. Also, I might pass Aptitude but I am not sure that I will be able to pass Group discussion or Personal Interview( I am somewhat introverted). If I fail again, I will be given a 1 year cool off.

Now these are my options :

1. I could prepare for and clear DGCA ground classes exams and then apply for FTA.
2. [AirAsia Cadet Program](https://cadetpilotindia.airasia.com/training-pathway/) : I could apply for that but AirAsia India isn't that great and the salary is a bit low. Also they haven't mentioned LOI( Letter of intent - It states that the airline will hire you after your training) anywhere in their website.

491,Fuel Emergencies; Really that often?,"As a new inexperienced pilot I try to watch a lot of accident case studies to try and learn from others mistakes. The number of fuel emergencies seems to be a lot.   


Is this really as frequent an issue as it seems to be? Surely most pilots aren't planning flights at fuel minimums often are they? Also I've seen a lot of ones where they are flying into known IMC conditions and are doing it barely getting there before hitting reserve fuel?   


Maybe I'm still too naive but it seems prudent to shoot an approach at airports along the route so that you never end up not being able to divert to a field completely clear of the weather. Now if you are a professional or highly proficient pilot and have flown down to minimums often and recently then I kind of can understand it but for the average pilot only flying in VFR conditions it doesn't make sense. I mean there's a huge difference to shooting approaches to minimums in VFR  as opposed to the real IMC situation right.

494,Flight Planning Questions from a Comp Sci Student/Future Pilot,"
I'm a prospective pilot (and have been for a while!), and I will be taking my discovery flight within the next couple of months. For now, however, I have decided to create a program for my Computer Science class that could both help me understand more about flying and potentially help GA in one way or another (although very, very likely not).

I'm looking to create a flight planning program, routing GA pilots from origin to destination, calculating range and airport stops needed to refuel. I am planning on including variables such as plane type, preferred altitude, weight, and weather (potentially, if I get around to it); however, what might be the best way for me to calculate this without POH's in front of me? Are there equations I might use to calculate these numbers?

Then, there is the added confusion of IFR vs VFR planning. Obviously, I would be unable to include VFR waypoints (if they are called that?) as there is no true database for them, but I am planning on incorporating IFR waypoints [that I can attain from here](http://navaid.com/GPX/). I read through [this post from last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/89ts4f/questions_about_ifr_flight_planning/) on planning IFR routes, but I still have some questions coming from it:

1. Where might I be able to find SIDs/Airways/STARs in a database format readable by my computer? (i.e. as a .csv or .gpx file)
    a. I see that SIDs/STARs are often in image format - are there spreadsheet versions of them?
2. How might one plan out a route from one airport to another using these? How do you decide which SID/STAR to use?
3. When listing the route, should I only list the SID/STAR names? Or the waypoints in them as well (for example, for KSEA, would I want to list SUMMA1 Departure or each individual waypoint in SUMMA1?)
4. How are altitudes incorporated into the mix? Is there an optimum altitude to fly, and how do fuel efficiencies work into this (both getting to altitude, maintaining, and on approaches)?

At the moment, I am still trying to make sense of how flight planning works (rather than just simply looking up my plane's flight plan haha) so please help me out and let me know if I am approaching the whole thing in the wrong way. Thank you for your help in advance!",flying,1576140755,Mcluk,18,1,True,2019-12-12
495,Some Words,"Hey everyone, 

I just wanted to let you all know that I went through a sort of… really tough time in my life recently. 

I used to feel on top of the world. I used to work a lot and fly airplanes all the time, and I felt really good at my job. I enjoyed my job (for the most part). The best part was that I had a community of pilots and ramp agents and people that I saw every week. I knew all of them, and I was able to interact and enjoyed catching up with them, talking about my life and asking about theirs. 

I changed jobs, and I spent a lot of time alone. Like, *retired person*, living in their house alone, with no one but their two cactus plants that are hard to keep alive… alone. Tom Hanks on an island alone. No Wilson even. 

It was awful. It is awful. It's not healthy. And I feel like some of us in this profession might be stuck in the same sort of place. Whether it's the airlines or… Any kind of flying/aviation job. It's not a good place to be in mentally. The boredom, the lack of motivation, the lack of purpose? Truly horrible feelings to have, and to deal with those feelings on your own is really hard, if not impossible. 

Telling people that you have a pretty nice salary, but you have too much time on your hands, sounds like the best problem ever! Most people work too much and are paid too little. So when you tell them about your life of being paid too much to work too little, they don't really understand what the ""problem"" is. 

Well I'm here to tell you, *it's a problem*. It's a big one. (that's what she said)

You know how retired people tend to cognitively decline as soon as they retire and stop being active? You know why they all start volunteering and trying to do other jobs for the rest of their able-bodied working lives? It's because being alone, being bored, being without a community, is utterly and completely awful. 

It is! I know you might have co-workers, friends, and family, that you just can't stand to be around. Everyone does. But guess what? At least you have people in your life. You have things to talk about. You have a purpose. That is so important. When you stop feeling like what you do matters, that's when things start to really go down hill. 

After a year and a half of doing basically *nothing* with my life… I finally hit the bottom.

And you know what? It felt great. 

It felt so good to feel... something. 

I swear, for the last year, and a half, I didn't feel anything at all. I was apathetic, I couldn't empathize with anyone around me. I've never been great with compassion or empathy to begin with, but I really… Didn't feel anything. 

Checking into hotels I couldn't look front desk people in the eyes, I didn't care to ask about their days, I didn't give a flying fuck. It was bad. Not just with strangers, but with co-workers. I'd ask about their lives a bit, but I didn't care. I didn't really listen that well. 

And then I got sad. Really sad. And lonely. Really lonely. And then I cried. And I cried. And I started to feel what it meant to be a person. What it means to have lost all hope. What it means to have emotions. What it is to be human. 

And that feeling? Horrible. Terrible, agonizing, and most of all, unbelievably humbling. 

And as I started to come out of it, I really felt like a completely different person. I felt like I had an epiphany. Like *a real epiphany*. I learned that everyone has emotions, and they're real! And they have a huge impact on how you go about your day. How you treat other people. How your outlook on life is, and what matters to you. 

I realized there are all these other people, trying to get through life, just like me. I'm not the center of the universe. I'm not the only person that matters. Every single person has their own life, goals, problems, moods, and stresses. It's a wild ride. 

It's been a process of sort of figuring out how to be social, have emotions, talk and care, really listen to someone else and try to see things from their point of view. I honestly felt like a completely different person from the moment I realized what it was like to put myself in someone else's shoes. Suddenly I'm asking as many questions about their life and how they feel about certain things as I can. I want them to feel listened to, appreciated, and important. 

I felt so different after my epiphany that I was honestly worried that I might have some sort of mental condition. Like, am I psychopath for having felt little to no empathy for so long? And why do I suddenly now feel it? Luckily, a psychiatrist friend did tell me that I'm not in fact a psychopath, but now, finally, just an emotionally mature adult. 

It's common for teenagers to not really think of anyone else except for themselves. But people usually grow out of that. They learn that the world is full of other people, and those people deserve just as much love and attention as you do. 

So, yeah r/flying, I know in our profession it can be hard to feel like you belong, it can be hard going to work and feeling imposter syndrome, it can be hard with the boredom and lack of purpose. Like really hard. Incredibly hard. 

So please, if you feel sad, lonely, anything, find someone to talk to. Doesn't matter who it is. A friend, a family member, a co-worker, a therapist, some random person on Reddit. Heck, PM me if you want to chat!

It's so important for us to take care of ourselves and one another.

0,When did my medical certificate expire?,"I was happy when current regs seem to suggest that I was eligible for basic med and further excited when [r/flying](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/) checked my work via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/ddsqoi/basic_med_eligibility/).

I  called the AOPA BasicMed Help Hotline this afternoon. I was informed of  some rule changes that occurred in 2008 that might have increased the  period in which a medical was valid.

I  was told that my medical pre-dated the rule changes and I missed the  basic med cutoff date (  July 14, 2006 ) by a month. I have not been  able to confirm this. I'm hoping the phone rep was incorrect as the 2008 rule changes seemed to only effect 1st and 3rd class medical  certificates.

3,Based airplanes,"Looking for another report, I came across the [SMO Based Aircraft report for 2019](https://www.smgov.net/departments/airport/agendas/2019/20190923/2019%20Based%20Aircraft%20List.pdf).

(I think that's probably an error, as ""P28A"" and ""PA28"" are separate entries that total about 10% of the based aircraft).

If people think about Mooney at all, it's as a distant fourth (?) place holder, following the 172, Cherokee, and interchangeably Beechcraft or Cirrus. Kind of surprised they're so well represented there.

7,Checkride passed! Write-up,"Alright some back story before we get to the checkride, and I’ll leave a TL;DR at the bottom for anyone interested. 

I was originally scheduled to take the checkride on Monday, but it got delayed due to weather (crap ceilings not even allowed to start the oral). I had chosen the plane I wanted to fly for the checkride and went for a proficiency flight on Sunday. Proficiency flight is good, and after the flight I’m starting to tab out the planes maintenance log when the scheduler comes and grabs me and tells me I’m gonna have to fly a different plane for a Monday. Fine, no big deal. I get the Mx log for that plane and tab it out no problem. Monday comes and we get pushed to Friday. Do another proficiency flight Thursday night in the plane I’m scheduled for on Friday, and that goes well. Only bad thing though.... I left my sectional, which has my XC flight plan all done on it , in the airplane. No problem, I’m pretty sure I’m the first one in the plane tomorrow anyway so I’ll get there early and grab it 

I also posted this post in the subreddit so I could get some outside questions to help me study and start reviewing things differently from the way I do or the way my CFI asks questions. I HIGHLY recommend doing something like this. Get an outside point of view to help you study, someone you aren’t used to because it definitely helped me find holes in my knowledge leading up to the checkride.

Alright checkride time. I live about 45 minutes away from my home airport, and I’m supposed to meet the DPE there at 9am. I wake up early, shower eat, throw on my lucky R2D2 socks and head for the airport, and I get there at around 8:10 with plenty of time to grab my sectional from the plane, and get all my docs sorted and ready to go. I’m pulling up past the runway and guess what I see in the run-up? You guessed it the plane I’m flying is about to take off. Fuck, no sectional, and the plane isn’t supposed to be back until 10am so I scramble to get my plan on ForeFlight as close as I could to the one on the sectional to match the flight planning forms I also had prepared.

Get all the Mx logs and other documents organized. It’s 8:30 so I’m just waiting on the DPE to show. Chief pilot comes and finds me and tells me that the plane I’m taking just got grounded for maintenance and that I need to pick a new plane. They put me back in the original plane, and now I’m scrambling to get the Mx logs for it and new weight and balances (DPE had me prepare one for the oral and one for the flight). Good news though, I go out to the plane and my sectional with the XC plan is right where I left it.

DPE shows up and I tell him what’s going on, and he tells me only to redo the flight portion weight and balance. We get started on IACRA paperwork, and then he finds one of endorsements is missing a date. I find my CFI, get it fixed and we start the oral. 

DPE starts with currency requirements, privileges and limitations (DPE was impressed with an analogy I have for incidental to the business exception for payment), and then we go through ARROW and Mx logs to determine that airplane is legal to fly. Next, DPE goes through scenarios for 91.205/213 required equipment and placarding inop. Then I present my XC flight plan and DPE asks questions throughout it. First asks about what equipment needed, I say 91.205 stuff and backdoored my way into transponder and radios (easy to overlook). We also mention survival equipment for different kinds of flights. Next I get questions about airspace, cloud clearance requirements, speed limits in a bravo and everything else DPE can point to on the map(definitely the most covered area). What happens if I’m bringing 2 friends and one is suddenly asleep in the back and the others face is blue and he’s giggling? What happens if friend in the back wakes up and is breathing really fast? 

Next, I answer questions about the weight and balances I have prepared. Didn’t ask me about forward vs rearward CG at all just how to recover from a spin. Then we cover systems: engine and electrical mostly. Oral is done and I do the weight and balance for the new plane. We go out to preflight, and while we’re waiting on the fuel truck to come fill up, DPE notices my R2 socks. We talk Star Wars for 10 minutes until the truck gets there. I’m a huge SW nerd and so is the DPE. Like it’s one of the first times I’ve met someone who is clearly as big a fan as me and can go step for step with me on expanded universe theories and characters. Awesome. 

Start up the plane no problem. Get ATIS and taxi to run up area. It’s busy and there’s several cessnas and a king air waiting. Do the run up and call up tower. Finally get cleared. Short field takeoff. I forgot to set the clock, and my headset was cutting in and out so DPE takes controls and I fix the headset. I start the clock and begin on the first 2 legs of my XC flightplan. Once we reach second checkpoint, DPE wants to do maneuvers. We clear the area, then do slow flight, steep turns, and then stalls (I asked about clearing turns before each maneuver and DPE really liked it). After stalls we do simulated engine out (I probably would’ve come short of the field I picked because I circled twice and they were too wide). Go around at 1000 MSL, and then we do turns around a point. 

From there we fly to a towered field about 15 miles away. Do a soft field landing (floated some but it was ok), soft field takeoff. Short field landing where DPE tells me runway starts at the 1000 footers and there’s trees on the threshold. Landed fine and started braking for a stop and go, but my foot slips off the brake and we make a sharp right turn. Kinda scary for a split second but I get it corrected. DPE says let’s go home, and we do a normal landing back at the home airport. Park the plane on the ramp and he says Bravo you’re a pilot once i print off some paper work. 

TL;DR checkride went well! Had to change the plane I was taking 30 min before the checkride started, which was stressful, but I got through it. Made mistakes on the checkride but kept flying and passed. Treat the DPE like a passenger, and fly as PIC and you’ll do just fine.",flying,1572646527,AIMIF,9,40,True,2019-11-01

13,Bendix-King Avionics (What I now call the NEW NARCO)," 

&gt;A Cautionary tale...  
When I started flying, the avionics available were pretty basic in the GA planes I flew in training and after receiving my PPL. I flew BE77 Skippers, C-150s, Piper Warriors and C-172s from the FBOs at KILM (Wilmington, NC). I used ARC/Sperry, Narco, and Collins ""Proline,"" but at that time (Think 1990-1991), Bendix-King was the ""Mac-daddy"" of the US General Avionics industry.  
My favorite training and rental plane was a Skipper. It was decked out for it's day, with the KMA24 Audio panel with Markers, dual KX-155 NavComs (one with glideslope), a KNS-80 RNAV unit (sweet in the pre-LORAN/GPS era), and an ADF receiver. It was a great plane in 1991.  
Flash forward to 2003, I now owned a PA-28-140E and had upgraded this plane from the bare basics, to a Garmin GMA-340, a KLN-89b GPS (approach certified), and dual KX-155 radios (one GS) and an AT-155 transponder from Narco, the last unit they had with surface mount technology before swithcing to the AT-165 units before they went bust. I later upgraded to the KLN-94 GPS, but soon found out that Bendix-King decided not to offer a WAAS upgrade path, which was the beginning of BK's abandonment of the GA market.  
Since then, Garmin has owned GA. Avidyne finally got to the market with their IFD units, but they were glitchy early on and are not really a major player. BK has half-heartedly played with their KSN-770, but it's really not much, and Garmin continues to march forward with more and better equipment. Still, I held some hope that BK would march back to excellence, but this was not to be, and that should have been clear to all when they decided to stop supporting their industry-standard KX-155 series NavComs. All down-hill from there.  
I did decide to give them another try, buying their KT-74 transmitter that could provide ADS-B out from a suitable WAAS GPS source. The unit (actually manufactured by Trig Avionics with BK faceplate) looked state of the art. My shop married it to my GNS430W and I had ADS-B. I hoped BK would take another step, like fixing their ill-fated KSN-770 or something new. This leads me to the rest of the story.  
I was flying IFR from KJNX to KMQI when I noticed that my KT-74 code was changing from the code ATC gave me to 2-2-2-2. The problem seems simple enough, it's a stuck #2 button. Otherwise the unit worked fine. I took the unit to my shop and eventually they informed be that the unit has to go back to the factory for the repair of one stuck button. The told me Bendix-King had a flat-rate repair charge of $973 and change. I know, that's pretty nasty for a minor problem like a simple stuck #2 button, but $973 is less that paying $2500 for a new transponder, so I said Ok and off the unit went to BK in September (2019). It gets worse from there.  
When the unit was evaluated by BK, they jacked up their ""flat-tate"" repair fee after I had already been quoted $973 before shipping them the unit.  Now they were demanding almost $1200. No explanation as to why they wouldn't honor their flat repair fee (and remember that this just is a stuck button). They did offer two other options though, as follows:  
1) They can return the unit to me unrepaired and uncertified for $581 (give or take a dollar), or  
2) They can graciously scarp the unit on site and still charge me the $581. Since I don't ever pay anyone for doing nothing, I chose to accept the (around) $1200 number, since it's still half the cost of a new transponder. Today is October 30th and I still don't have my transponder. You can't actually talk to anyone at BK. The shop was able to get a hold of a sale rep, but he couldn't explain the issue and personally told the shop (I don't have any idea what those guys are doing...sorry).  
Anyway, with an instrument student arriving for training, I had to buy a new KT-74 from Gulf Coast avionics (fortunately for less than retail) had the unit overnighted to me. My shop configured and certified the unit, and all this was accomplished in under 24 hours.  Bendix-King had the unit for over a month, That is service, something that BK apparently no longer knows anything about. Those guys in Kansas can kiss my grits. They should really just change their name from Bendix-King, to ""Bendix-King, we're ""The New Narco.""

32,Help deciding between two Toronto / GTA area schools - Durham vs Buttonville,"Hi r/flying

I'm looking at two schools in the GTA: Canadian Flyers at buttonville and Durham flight centre at Oshawa. I eventually plan to get CPL. Canadian Flyers is going to have a CPL program soon. 

I'm leaning towards Durham for two reasons 1) the aircraft at Durham seem much newer and in better shape. I know this doesn't mean much but it feeds into 2) The rates appear to be much lower at Durham. 

Canadian Flyers is only flying 172s. The rate is 187 for plane and 85 for instructor. Durham is 125 an hour for 150s (145 for a 172) and instructor $65. 

I'm trying to keep this affordable, and working 3 jobs to make it happen. I'll primarily fly on weekends until I can pivot out of one of my jobs, then start working weekends at another job and train during the week (less busy time). 

The two concerns I have are 1) instructor availability at Durham as they seem much busier. and 2) are there any hidden costs I could be missing that make the overall costs more equivalent?

 Does anyone have experience at either school or any guidance in trying to find the best value at a school? The folks at Candian Flyers seem very upfront and honest about their rates although they seem to be on the more expensive side.

39,Should I give up flying due to medical?,"Between 2014 and 2016 I had put 20 hours in my logbook, I was getting ready to solo, but put it off because around that same time I realized I was trans and needed the money to transition. I started HRT in 2016, and have been on it since. Fast forward to a few months ago, and I finally got put on sertraline for transition-related social anxiety, figuring it was an FAA-approved SSRI so I'd be fine. I want to emphasize that I wasn't 'diagnosed' with anxiety per se. The difference has been night and day, I'm not afraid to go out and do things now, and my finances have improved a bit (unrelated), so I wanted to start flying again.

I looked into getting my 3rd class, and I'm sure you know where this is going. The HRT because I've been on for less than 5 years requires a waiver, and possibly a psychiatric eval? The SSRI I've heard nothing but horror stories of of $7,000 of psych evals at highly specialized FAA psychiatrists. Possibly even if I stopped taking the SSRI? I don't intent to take the SSRI forever, and I haven't seen an AME or submitted any MedXpress forms yet, because I'm terrified of being denied and having to appeal.

Sport Pilot is not really an option since there are no LSAs for rent near me. I also live in Class C airspace, and my ultimate goal was IFR.

57,Passed PPL Checkride! (Large Write-up Within),"I'm happy to share that I'm now an official licensed pilot. This was quite the journey for a working adult. I chose a 141 program back in March because of the process oriented approach - I needed the extra effort to organize the curriculum since I have very limited free time. 57 hours later, here I am making this post finally. Apologies for the spelling errors, I'm exhausted right now. I'm writing this since it's fresh in my mind.

**The checkride:** I was originally scheduled with another DPE earlier in the week out of KEBA. The weather was absolutely horrible in Atlanta. I was actually scheduled to takeoff to meet the examiner at his homebase near the same time the privately owned PA28 crashed after takeoff at PDK (R.I.P.). The DPE gave us a reschedule date 2-3+ months in the future with the hopes of fitting me in sooner. Completely bummed, I was expecting the worst. My CFI pulled some magic out of his hat and found another examiner in Pratville, AL that had an opening this morning at 8am! It was an 1.5 hours flight from PDK, but I wasn't going to miss this opportunity. We left this morning around 6:45am EST in the early morning pitchblack/misty weather (which was actually a pretty amazing experience since KPDK was still a class E airport).

**The preparation:** To summarize, I over-prepared completely. But it was 100% appreciated by the DPE &amp; my instructor. I was asked to plan a flight from 1A9 to KSAV. This was fairly simple. The DPE allowed us to use the weather the night before (Friday night) as opposed to the morning of. On Friday night, I filled out the nav log, went to aviationweather.org and printed out about 10-12 different charts that explained the choices I made. There was basically 0 winds, 0 AIRMETS/SIGMETS in route. It was incredibly easy to do the calculations.

I created a personalized binder that had 5 tabs; Flight Plan; Weather, Peformance Data, W+B calculations, and ""resources,"" In the flight plan section, I had the completed Nav Log, Printed NOTAMs/TAFs enroute, a filled out ICAO Flight Plan (in case I needed to use FSS), and a landing cross-wind component chart. The weather tab had my 10-12 pages of weather (surface analysis, winds aloft, metars enroute, TAFs enroute, AIRMETS, SIGMENTS, PIREPS, Cloud coverage, radar). The Performance Data tab is where I took about 15 pages from the POH and filled in the graphs. I calculated everything from takeoff distance requirements, time/distance/fuel to climb, cruise performence charts, time/distance/fuel to descend &amp; landing length requirements with the updated weight at time of arrival. The W&amp;B calculations tab had a different sheet for takeoff/landing and another page with the POH normal/utility chart with the given weight/CG location. Lastly, in the ""resources"" section, I defined someone personal minimums &amp; copies of performance charts in case the DPE wanted me to recalculate something.

**The oral portion:** (from what I remembered): He first asked what a private pilot certificate entitles me with &amp; what it doesn't. Asked about the airworthiness of the plan &amp; asked me to show him in the logs the various inspections (AAV1ATE). Something I discovered quickly (which I don't think is a bad thing), but when you answer questions and give more details than required, he'll ask follow-up questions on the new piece of information. I imagine he did this since it would check off a later item that he needed to ask anyway. I didn't get the aircraft logs until the day of, so I didn't have a chance to tab anything. It took me longer than I'd like (~5 minutes), but I located all the signoffs of the inspections.

He then asked me about preparation on what I'd take under consideration for every flight. I answered with the PAVE/NWKRAFT acronym information &amp; that seemed to be exactly what he was looking for. For ""P"" in pave, I refereced the IMSAFE checklist. After a few back &amp; forth follup questions, we got into the weather.

The weather was a lot shorter than I thought. I explained that the plan called for basically no weather to be concerned about. I started on the surface analysis chart &amp; and he asked what ""H"" and ""L"" was, characteristcs of them (which way they rotated, etc), asked me what the lines represented (squall lines) &amp; what should I expect if the lines were close together (high winds!). On the METAR print-out, he had me read a couple. He asked me about the items after the RMK area (he caught me here, I had no idea what it meant). I fumbled around a little and started to open my FAR/AIM book when he said we can come back to it - because it was more for commercial pilots. He then asked me something, that in hindsight I already knew, but the way he asked the question was just entirely new to me. He asked what the importance was of knowing the wind during landing. I answered with to understand which RWY to land on, and what to expect from a cross-wind perspective. Long story short, what he was looking for was for me to understand the importance of ground speed on landing. How the indicated airspeed =/= ground speed. So a 10kt headwind on an indicated airspeed of 75, would have a ground speed of 65. He then talked about how it would effect my landing distance v. a tailwind, etc.

He then transition to aircraft systems (my worst subject). Asked me about the engine, fuel pump, the alternators on the plane, magnetos, electrical system, carburetor, purpose of a fuel pump &amp; when its needed &amp; for what purpose. Somehow I managed to get through this without much conern from him. I did mess up on the alternator stuff. He could tell I wasn't very articulate so he asked me follow-up questions about how to determine if the alternator failed, etc. I got through that nicely (the plane I fly has a load meter). The aircraft discussion transitioned into him asking what the VFR instrument requirements were (day &amp; night). I went through the ATOMATOEFLAMES/FLAPS &amp; he corrected a few of the nuances. For example, he said a landing light at night isn't required unless you were a commercial opperator (I might have this mixed up with something different). I brought up the fact that all the (day) instrument requirements didn't require an electrical source - he agreed &amp; asked what happens if something was INOP. Can you takeoff? What can you do if you need to take the plane somewhere? He definately tested my understanding of ""legal"" requirements and if legal, if it was a ""smart"" thing to do, etc.

After he was satisfied, he asked me about the flight plan. I gave him the log &amp; brought out a sectional chart. He asked me why I selected the waypoints, obstructions along the route, asked me to explain TAS &amp; Density altitude, and a couple other questions that I don't remember. Along the route, I used the columbus (CSG) VOR &amp; read a notom the night before that it was actually INOP. I brought this up &amp; he explained that VORs are kind of going away due to GPS, but how they're still useful. It was actually quite brief &amp; was fully expecting him to ask me about every single column on my custom nav log (I had a column for airspace, planned IAS/CAS/TAS/True course/oat/winds/wca/etc...). He moved on quickly to the sectional chart. He pointed to a few things &amp; asked me what it was; VFR Checkpoint, military training routes (asked about the altitude I would expect military flights to fly on each type), TRSA around our departure airport, VFR airways, class G airspace altitutes v. class E. He then flipped the chart over and went to the class B airspace at KATL. I'm based in KPDK (under the mode C viel), so I nailed all his questions. ""Tell me the airspace from the ground up here"" - the area he pointed at was in this order; G&gt;E&gt;B&gt;E&gt;A. He then asked me about weather minimums in each of them &amp; equipment requirements. Lastly, he asked what special VFR is and asked me if it's needed at an airport he pointed to (he pointed to both a class G &amp; class E airport).


**Passed the oral at this point (~1 hour, 45 minutes later).** 


**The flight portion:** Pre-flight was uneventful except when he asked about the ELT. I couldn't answer a question on how it's activated. I knew from studying what the inspection requirements were &amp; how it can be tested &lt;5 minutes after the top of each hour, but since I thought this was something maintenance/aircraft owners was responsible for, I never really asked about it. He put on his instructor hat at this point and explained that there should be guage in the cockpit to test it &amp; that it can either manually be turned on, or under certain G-Load, it can turn on automatically (and of course manually turning it on after unscrewing the panel on the side of the plane). When we got in the plane, there it was. It was literally the only guage that I never really looked at or realized was there.

Normal takeoff: I made a huge error here. The takeoff was great but my departure from the airport was not safe. Since I mostly trained from a busy class-D, I always recieved ""right turnout approved"" etc. After takeoff (class G airport), I climbed to 500' feet and departed using a right turn. After the checkride was complete, he briefed me on why this was un-safe. On climb-out, I could have made it un-safe for pilots coming into the airport, specifically the aircraft flying over the field to enter the pattern. He mentioned you ALWAYS depart from the pattern. Or, if turning right, maintain runway heading until 500 feet above the pattern altitude and then turn on-course (while still climbing obviously).

There was heavy glider/parachute operations active at an airport enroute to the first checkpoint (08A), so I deviated more to the left of my route to stay clear. During the climbout, the DPE simulated TRSA services &amp; I responded to him appropriately. At the first checkpoint, he killed GPS/Foreflight &amp; deviated me to an airport 30nm away. It was one of the only airports I didn't prepare for - No problem, I got this. On the paper charts, I immediately figured out the heading. I had a plotter handy so I quickly gave him the 3 pieces of information he asked for (distance/time/fuel requirements). For the time/fuel, I invested in a watch that has an e6b wheel. It paid for itself in that one moment. Since I was unfamiliar with the area, I was freaking out a little bit here. I couldn't find anything outside that matched what was on the chart. In the de-brief he mentioned that he LOVED that I was looking outside of the plane for landmarks and THEN reference the chart (he said most students do the opposite). Since I couldn't recognize anything at all, and I knew I had a good 25-30 miles to go. I tuned in the two closet VORs on NAV1 &amp; NAV2. Every minute I would visualize in my brain where I was at based on the two radials I was on. This worked beautifully. This continued for 10 minutes (it was incredibly draining). I knew I was close. I asked him (as a passenger), to keep an eye out for some powerlines (I noticed some powerlines would take me there). Anyway, I eventually came within 5 miles of the airport and he said, ""Oh look, powerlines."" I followed the powerlines on the horizon and bingo - there it was. Whew.

He then asked me what I'd prefer, landings first or aerial work. I went with landings. We approached the diversion field (07A) and I started my radio work. Since there's no weather reporting at this airfield (and nothing nearby), I made a comment that the winds should be similar to our depature airport and decided on the (correct) runway to land. He decided on the touchdown point (start of the 1st aircraft marker) and kindly reminded me I needed to touch down within 200ft past that point. On short approach, I realized that I was calling out the wrong runway number on the field (I think I was saying rwy 27 on my callouts when it was rwy 32). I let him know of this mistake and didn't make it again. I nailed the shortfield landing. He asked me to taxiback &amp; perform a shortfield takeoff with no obstruction. I briefed the takeoff &amp; nailed it.

On the second approach, he asked for a forward slip to land. He had no preference for flaps &amp; I decided to use them. On the first attempt, I messed up. The slip was correct but what I failed to do was power to idle and pitch for speed. After it was clear that I was doing something incorrect, I aborted the approach and announced I was going around. In the next 10 seconds, it finally hit me what I did wrong and I told him. If I remember, he had no comments. In either case, my 2nd attempt was perfect. I went power idle, performed the slip with power idle &amp; pitched for speed. Nailed it. Just a reminder to all that this landing requires a landing within 400 feet past the landing point specified. After this landing, he then gave me a verbal confirmation that I correctly identified what I did wrong &amp; liked that I went around to correct it. He then asked for a soft-field takeoff and depart the pattern straight out. This was uneventful.

Aerial work was next. My CFI grilled into my brain to do clearing turns - which I did. This part is boring, but we did steep turns, slow flight, unusual attitudes, etc - basically everything in the ACS. During slowflight, the stall warning came on for a split second. It was at a much higher speed than usual. I jokingly said, ""well it looks like the aircraft wants to stall at a higher speed today."" He then jokingly said something like, ""Hey, I'm not fat! I'm just really tall!"" I went ahead and used a higher ""slow flight"" speed than usual and never heard the stall horn again. For the ground reference manuever, I chose an altitude of 800 feet (he asked me a good altitude for this, know the requirements here).

After aerial work, he allowed me to use GPS/Foreflight for the return trip home. I selected the cruise altitude &amp; proceeded direct via GPS. There again was a lot of glider/skydiving activity (including a bunch of C-130s landing at Maxwell AFB) so I decided to utilize the TRSA services. I called up Montgomery approach and after a couple turns directed by ATC (to avoid some C-130s on approach), radar services were termined and I was about 5 miles from the starting point of this adventure. The DPE asked how I was going to enter the pattern. I responded with, ""well, I want to join the pattern on a 45 to downwind..."" He just reponded with ""Okay."" After thinking some more and looking at the airspace (Maxwell AFB and Montgomery both Class Ds, are very close), I changed my mind and decided to fly above the field instead of doing an awkward entry into downwind. He definately agreed with that choice. He requested a softfield landing. Even though it was a very smooth landing, considering how bumpy the air was, this was the first time I've ever ""bounced"" during a landing. Even though it was only a couple of feet, he commented that he liked how I held my attitude &amp; let the aircraft come back down on its own. We went into parking, and he non-challantly said, let's head in and de-brief &amp; that he'd pring my temporary certificate.

---------------

The checkride was a great experience. I understand the purpose of it is to make sure I'm a safe pilot &amp; for the FAA to give me a license. More than that though, it really helped me determine what I'm good at &amp; what I'm not good at. I would 100% be okay if I failed. I would actually be very thankful if I was not meeting the requirements to operate an aircraft safely &amp; the instructor didn't clear me. Putting yourself in their shoes, it's probably a hard thing to tell someone they failed... given that they worked so hard, spending X amount of $, just to get to that point. I have no aspirations to fly professionally. My only aspirations are to fly safe, share this passion of mine with people that are close to me, and enjoy myself.

I hope this write-up helped someone who's preparing for their checkride.

A team of 200 of us Pilots and Dispatchers have formed a group (**The Notam Team**) to expedite getting these things out of the 1920's. Below is the full post, but if you'd take a moment to help our forward momentum and [**sign the petition**](https://www.change.org/p/the-aviation-community-help-pilots-get-critical-flight-information-fix-the-notam-system) at [change.org](https://change.org) \- that would be AWESOME. Thank you!  


\---

Aviation prides itself on safety. There is a glaring gap.  


Every day, every airline (and private) flight in the world: Pilots are forced to use a broken, archaic briefing system from the 1920's, and as a result, **they regularly miss critical flight information**.

What would have been the single worst disaster in aviation history - [Air Canada 759](https://fixingnotams.org/reel-of-telegrams/), in July 2017 - was averted by only 1 second. The cause: this flawed briefing system, meaning the pilots did not realize their runway was closed.

The briefing system, or Notices to Airmen ([NOTAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOTAM)) is a worldwide standard, and presents information in a coded, upper case, incredibly un-human-friendly format, is overloaded with irrelevant information, and creates 100 page briefing packages for flight crews that are simply impossible to read and understand. For every pilot and passenger alike, **this creates unacceptable risk**.  


It is imperative that **change comes soon**. [Support this petition](https://www.change.org/p/the-aviation-community-help-pilots-get-critical-flight-information-fix-the-notam-system) to underscore the importance of bringing change to the NOTAM system.

87,Flair Change! IFR checkride post,"Tl;DR: I passed my IFR checkride. Thanks to everyone for posting in r/flying because it was a huge help to me

**Oral:** We started out with 20 minutes of paperwork, making sure I had my hours, etc etc. The DPE was super friendly and put me at ease, but he was also very by the book. He took out the ACS, started flipping pages and told me that we were going to talk about each section. The grilling took about an hour. It's obviously tough to recall every question, but I'll hit the high points and update if I think of anything else:

\-Maintaining currency, personal minimums

\-Weather: what sources of weather did I check before coming out to the airport; define atmospheric stability (then he asked if the atmosphere was stable or unstable if it was 10 degrees at sea level and 8 degrees at 3,000 ft); what kind of onboard weather do I have in my aircraft and what are the limitations of it (I didn't know what my club's plane had for onboard weather, but I knew the limitations of the ADSB weather on my iPad/Sentry); types of icing; weather requiring an alternate

\-Flight plan: TAS; fuel required for the trip (and IFR fuel requirements); procedure for closing the flight plan

\-Anti/de-icing equipment available in my aircraft (just pitot heat)

\-Instruments: he had me draw the six pack then he asked which was not required for IFR flight; which ran on pitot-static; which were vacuum; WAAS; VOR checks (multiple questions about how to do them, the tolerances, and what has to be in the endorsement); what does ""2 min"" mean on the turn coordinator

\-Approaches: structure/size of the window on an ILS approach; he showed me a plate with a DME arc and asked what heading I would fly entering the arc from the feeder route; the airport I planned a flight to had an ILS Y and Z so he asked me the differences between the two, how I would choose, whether I could fly the Z today, and whether I could fly the Z with a 20 kt tailwind (took me a minute of staring at them to see the difference, then I walked him through calculating climb performance in the POH); pointed to a published missed procedure and asked the correct holding pattern entry procedure

\-Misc: define MEA and MOCA; define VOR changeover point; procedure for recovering from a nose down unusual attitude; procedure for recovering from a spin; there was a lost com question that was kind of scenario based; he asked a question about what I would do if I lost the vacuum system (wanted to see that I would declare an emergency)

&amp;#x200B;

**Flight:** I passed, but it felt like barely. I was a little fried from the oral, and I got a bit stressed when the club's maintenance logs weren't where they were supposed to be, so I was probably a bit frazzled as we got going.  I wound up having to get the FBO to open the maintenance shop so I could grab the logs (the plane had a mag replaced a week ago). Anyway, got all that straightened out and got on with it. The plan was to take off VFR (he gave me a mock clearance to copy down), fly to a nearby towered field, do the ILS, then go missed, then fly an RNAV coupled and circle to the previous runway, then fly the published missed and hold, then do another ILS partial panel and head back to the home airport (with unusual attitudes on the way) and do the RNAV there. 

You'll notice that's 4 approaches. The DPE typically does 3 approaches on his checkrides, but we did the 4th because I told him that circling at my home airport per his original plan violates my personal minimums. I refuse to circle at a non towered airport with a single runway - I know people do it but it strikes me as insane, particularly on a VFR day with traffic in the pattern taking off right at you when you're on final. He kind of chuckled but he respected it.

It was a beautiful day for flying, but I just found myself getting thrown off my game. Normally I flip on the A/P enroute while I get ready for the approach but he said not to use it except for the coupled approach. That's fine. Then we found out that the ILS we planned to do was out of service so we needed to plan for the RNAV (which meant distracting myself getting the other plate, etc.). Then we weren't allowed to fly the published missed so we had to plan on doing a course reversal hold back at the home airport. I also kept second guessing myself on the avionics - a lot of superfluous button pushing and wondering why it wasn't doing what I wanted to do, probably due to nerves because I do know how to use them. No huge errors and nothing really crazy happening, but a bunch of little things that put together made me look/feel a little sloppy. Kept it within tolerances though. I thought he was fair about dinging me when I deserved it, but I also think I did a good job handling the stressors he threw at me (I was a little fast crossing the FAF and he told me I had to maintain that speed, which I did, but it was ""one more thing"" on top of everything else).

One thing that happened, and this is what I think makes the DPE a really good DPE, is he took time to teach me things. He noticed I was gripping the control stick (DA-40) really hard (again probably due to nerves), and it was making it difficult for me to keep the plane level/in-trim. On the last approach (it was an LNAV + V) he told me not to touch the stick at all, and instead to use just power, trim and rudder to keep the needles centered. It was a cool lesson, and not something you expect on a checkride. 

After we landed he told me I passed and we had a debrief on the things I need to work on. I highly, highly recommend him for anyone taking a checkride in NJ (DM me for the name).

**Falling on my face:** Literally. So, after we landed I taxied over to the fuel pump to refuel while the DPE ran into the FBO to do the paperwork. For the first time ever though I drove the right main gear off the asphalt and onto the grass, which had nice deep mud from the monsoons on Thursday, and got stuck (not even close enough to the pump to refuel while getting unstuck). Crap. We shut off the engine and got out. We tried pushing it and it didn't go anywhere. We took out the tow bar and both pulled. Still nothing. Then I remembered my club had a tug so I went and grabbed it from the shed. When I got back there were a couple guys from the FBO offering to pitch in. I fumbled for 10 minutes or so getting the tug hooked up, during which, like right after the DPE told me to be careful, I managed to faceplant in the mud. Good times. At least the DPE and FBO guys were amused. We eventually got the plane out and refueled, and the DPE helped me tow it back to the parking spot and tie it down (my brain wasn't functioning at this point so I don't think I could have even turned the engine on in that state, let alone taxied). I checked with the DPE to make sure my display over by the fuel pumps hadn't caused him to change his mind, but he said the paperwork was already done and congratulated me again.",flying,1572834160,dwinddy,6,17,True,2019-11-03

103,Do I need a bachelors degree on an aviation-related course to get into Airline companies as a Commercial Pilot?,"Hi everyone! This is my very first post here so I may be out of place. If I am, please lead me to where this post belongs. Please take time to read this, I badly need advice. I know this might have been posted several times  already and yes I have already read different threads and articles about this topic, but I  just wanted to ask myself. Just a little background, I am a 17 year old boy and I am midway through my last year of Senior High School (Grade 12). I do wear glasses and my eye grades are high (Though it is not related to this post, I just thought you should know). 

&amp;#x200B;

So as Grade 12 slowly starts to end, I'm kind of torn on what college I should go to. I only have **two** options:

1. *Stay in my current university and take up a four-year course of Computer Science*. I will be having 15% discount on my college tuition and could possibly get 100% off (I will be taking an exam to see if I could qualify, if  I don't, I could still have the chance to get 25% or 50% off which could add up to the 15% discount). The university I am currently in is not too far from home which means I won't have to live in a dorm, which then means I won't have to pay extra to live in one.
2. *Go to a college of Aeronautics and take up a course of Aeronautical Engineering (I am not sure whether it is a 4 or 5 year course).* I won't have any discount on this university. This university is very far from home. Fortunately though, I may have a chance to live in a condominium together with my uncle (Note: **may** have a chance). The commute from the condominium to the university would be less than an hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to be asked, I'd rather stay in my current university. This is because I've looked up the requirements to be a commercial pilot of a major airline company in my country (Philippines) that I wish to be in, and it says that it could be **any** four-year course.  Another reason is that I have asked some pilots on that airline (My uncle, who owns the condominium that I may have the chance to live in, is a flight attendant of that airline and has friends who work there as a commercial pilot) on what course did they take. One even told me that he took Tourism on the university that I am currently in just to get a four-year course because for him, Tourism was the easiest and he didn't want to have a hard time in college. I've also recently read an article that a person became an airline pilot (Different airline) even with a degree that is far from aviation (She took Nursing).

**HOWEVER,** I realize now that getting into an airline is a competition, and those who got better resumes have a higher chance of getting in. If I stay in my current university, me standing out from the others will not happen because of the combination of very blurry eyesight and a course that is not related to aviation. Of course they would choose those who have a near to 20/20 vision and have a bachelors degree that is aviation related than me (If I did stay in my current university). At the moment, this is the only reason I can think of for me to go for my option two besides having background knowledge on planes.

Background:  I'm 31, about to start a serving job and hope to make anywhere from 400-700 per week.  Finished my PPL a few weeks ago and am looking at a few smaller schools in the Jacksonville, FL area to continue with my instrument, commercial, CFI, and multi add on.    

The two main lenders I'm looking at are Sallie Mae and AOPA.  I've taken a loan through Sallie Mae in the passed for my University degree and had a relatively good experience with that, so at least with them I know what to expect.  Another positive for Sallie Mae is the lower repayment options while I'm training and even deferred option until after I finish.

None of the schools I'm considering have a relationship with Sallie Mae yet, so I'll have to get the school to contact them and start that process.  That could take a month or two so I'll work and study for my instrument written to have that completed when I start training.  

I'm waiting to hear back from the schools to sit down with them, estimate real costs to finish training and see if they have any lenders they already work.  I'm estimating it will cost somewhere around 40-50k for everything, I haven't crunched numbers yet for total amounts but that's what I'm expecting.

128,Aspiring pilot,"Hello everyone! 

For most of my life I have dreamed of flying. Until now I’ve never had the opportunity to follow my dream but due to recent events I may be able to follow that now. I have done a lot of thinking and I’ve done about as much research as I can but I haven’t had the conversation with others yet. 

When it comes to flight school, would you rather go to a snail private school or a larger designated school like ATP and why? 

My local community college seems to have a great program as well, what would your reason be as to go there or not? 

I know there is going to be/already is a pilot shortage. How viable is that? Is there actually a severe demand? Do you worry about the job becoming more automated inevitably killing the need for more pilots? 

People warn me about being a pilot as there is “too much” down time sitting in a cockpit not actually “flying”. I feel as though that would be a small thing to overcome, especially doing something you love. 

As a newer pilot are you really gone from your family that often? I know that as seniority increases you work less but in the beginning how much could you expect to be gone? 

TIA for any and all information you can give me. I’m really looking forward to the future and can’t wait to get started, it is all I think about!",flying,1572925806,Impeachthis,19,0,True,2019-11-04

When I first got my licenses I took some flying lessons in a Cessna 172 and Robinson 22, and I loved every second of it, particularly the R22.

1) I have a DWAI (Driving While Ability Impaired) from over 10 years ago. There was an arrest, was fingerprinted, and took MADD classes. I was told from the courthouse and a few attorneys this is a driving infraction and not a criminal charge as a DUI or DWI. 

Will this be an uphill battle for 1st class? I'm in my mid-30s and have had no other arrests or any court case of any kind. 

2) I'm 6'1 - 300lb (down from 350)

From searches I looked through the forum I think it's recommended to book a consult with an AME with the paperwork and see their professional opinion. 

Can I openly discuss my history with the AME, and my goal or is it best just to keep quiet and say I'd like a consult to see if I can get a 1st class medical. 

3) I have some CC debt, is there a financial background check at any point?

135,[EASA] Orthostatic syncope,"Just to set your minds at rest, I got a Class 1 EASA medical and am using the Class 2 portion of this to cover me for my flying under my PPL, so I know I'm generally speaking in good health.

However, I've long known that when I stand up having sat/lied down for a while, I need to be a bit careful, as otherwise I'll feel a little faint. Recently I had an incident where I fainted because I was not careful when this happened. Medical assistance was called but I was fine just minutes or seconds afterwards. I had an ECG, blood pressure and so on measured and it was concluded that it's simply that I have an underlying relatively low blood pressure and that due to my stature this can cause  an excessively low blood pressure upon rapid standing up.

After a bit of research I now know this to be the common condition known as orthostatic syncope. I just came across the thought of wondering whether I need to declare this to my national aviation authority as a change of medical circumstances (even though it's something I've had for many years, perhaps without knowing it's a named condition).

I would hate to lose my medical and potentially waste all the money I've invested into my flying hours and experience over something as silly as this. equally I can't afford to pay loads of money to have private medical tests etc done. It isn't an issue during flight as obviously you have to sit down during the entire flight in the kind of aircraft you fly with a PPL SEPL and is only ever even potentially an issue if I stand up carelessly.

I guess the legal answer is probably that I should declare it and risk never being able to fly again. But really my question isn't a legal one - it's whether you would declare this if you were in my shoes. If anyone has any similar stories I'd be interested to hear them.

Details are vague for hopefully obvious reasons.",flying,1572949977,oeneitntkdnd,7,0,True,2019-11-05
136,Medical struggles difficult enough that i'm getting burned out on aviation. A mix of me venting and asking for advice,"Preamble, i'm talking about EASA but i don't need much specific advice, i already have sources for that. Still, any ideas and comments are welcome. I'm questioning aviation in general regardless of country and questioning myself.

My problem is i had two seizures as a child.  
I was issued a time-limited Class 1 three times, each time the neurologist saying that i'm ok to go for now and if everything remains stable i'd be fine and at most i'd get a multicrew limited Class 1. Then a sudden denial. Found out too late it was because somebody in the government body applied a wrong regulation that didn't actually apply to me, because actually i have *not* had any head injuries resulting in loss of conscience. Then the latest visit. I'm told my situation is stable and my EEGs are still identical to all the previous ones, thus i can't be issued a Class 1 because while i'm fine on the seizure/epilepsy part (basically it's seen as a moment i had a literal brain fart that can happen during childhood because the brain is in development) the EEG anomalies i have are disqualifying.

The thing is, it seems to check out. The regulations specifically mention two types of EEG anomalies, and looking at my EEGs it seems i do have them or something very similar. Regulations mention ""focal slow waves"" as disqualifying, and a couple of my exams mention ""diffused slowdowns"" and ""physiological slow downs of brain activity"". It's not exactly the same but it's concerningly close.

But then why was i issued a Class 1 for three times? No one seems to know, not even the neurologist who green-lit me multiple times. I know it's not the case, but it does feel like someone is messing with me and it's pissing me off.

These events have made me question myself a lot. I've already noticed for several months that the burning passion and drive i had in the past seem to be gone. Aviation is still my strongest interest by a wide margin, but i'm questioning whether i still want to *work* as a pilot. I worry that even if i get a Class 1 it will be such a borderline case that every renewal will be a gamble. The job's drawbacks suddenly seem much bigger than before (the random workdays, work hours, the general instability, difficulties of having a social life when everyone else has wildly different times than you and difficulty of long term planning) and i'm starting whether i'm actually fit to be a pilot since i tend to be a lonely introvert.

1: I was in an auto accident in 2011 and sustained a concussion.  Their was a short loss of conscience but my bigger concern is I had memory loss for about a week after the incident.  I was cleared by the neurologist while I was in the hospital and don’t have any long term effects that I have observed in the almost 9 years since.  Their is simply a hole of about a week in my memory that I was told was due to the bruising and swelling while my brain healed.  I feel like this one is my biggest concern, how much it will complicate things and add expense to get my first class?

2: As a child I was diagnosed with ADHD.  It was the 90’s and I feel like it was the diagnosis of choice.  I have not taken any medication since I was roughly 10 years old in the year 2000.  Will I have to go through the process of denial and appeal due to that diagnosis over 20 years ago or will the extended time since I showed symptoms that required medication be enough to make it a non-factor?

3: I am roughly 6’ and 260lbs.  I feel like this is the least serious factor as if I am committed I  feel like I can change up some habbits and lose weight down to a more ideal weight, but am just curious how much of an issue it will be?

I’d appreciate opinions on these things, and am also curious if it is possible to have a consult with an AME without actually doing the whole first class application and possibly getting it deferred or denied, which I understand becomes a possible issue down the road even if you do correct issues.  I am also just outside Charlotte, NC if anyone local has any suggestions.  I appreciate it all in advance",flying,1572959811,Wes_WM,1,0,True,2019-11-05

152,Medical special issuance timeline,"Hi all, just a little background on my situation. I'm currently in the process of getting my instrument rating after a 5 year hiatus from flying. About 2 years ago, my primary doctor prescribed an SSRI to help me with moderate depression and put me on a CPAP for mild sleep apnea. Both the medication and CPAP have helped me greatly, but of course I didn't think twice about it when applying for my 3rd class last June. I got a letter from the FAA requesting a bunch of doctors notes and tests (thankfully the SSRI was on their approved list), and so went to another AME to help me through the process.

 It took almost 5 months to get all the appointments  scheduled and completed and all the paperwork from 4 different doctors collected (FAA gave 90 days, which was practically impossible) and the final package was sent by my AME to the FAA in the beginning of January this year. I have yet to hear back from the admin, and when I called the medical branch about the status of my application 6 weeks ago, all I was told was that it was ""in review"". 

I know the FAA is notorious for being slow, but now at 11 months (10 if you take into account the shutdown in January) seems like a ridiculous time frame to review the paperwork. Are other people dealing with these kinds of delays? I'm not sure what to other than sit on my hands..

Not a morning goes by that I don’t think about lifting off the runway with a fuselage full of ULDs, or maybe just some kids bike strapped to the strut. 

Chances are, by the time I receive my restricted medical, I’ll be nearing 30 and just starting flight training.  I feel so overwhelmed with training options and education that I don’t think I can obtain enough money to do both flight training and get a four year degree.

I won’t have my medical until I’m 30 and don’t have enough money for both flight training and a four year degree. I don’t have any family in the aviation industry.

176,Why not hybrid electric?,"It feels like GA pistons are made for hybrid electric:

1. We only use significant excess power at takeoff, with a “bit” of extra power in climb - so you could run a pretty small battery.
2. Singles could have some redundancy available in the event of engine failure to fly them to a suitable landing area.
3. If paired with a low HP diesel (eg. Austro) you replace a 235HP Lycominental with a 135HP diesel and a 100HP electric. Once at cruise the extra grunt from the electric motor is not needed. Less than half the fuel burn and running JET-A.
4. I feel like there must be an opportunity to move away from engines that cost more than a BMW X5 Just to overhaul and instead find a way of shoehorning the bottom end of mass-produced auto engines into GA.
5. Many GA pistons are only used for a single mission on any given day. They can deal with being plugged in for a few hours.

So.... why are there electric planes already being developed, but no hybrids? There is (IMO) a very limited market for an all-electric aircraft, yet if someone was clever enough, the overhaul and replacement market for Avgas-burners is huge!",flying,1573037551,KRAP140,46,31,True,2019-11-06

It's been a **hot** minute since the last update but a lot has been going on behind the scenes here and I wanted to do an update.  So the plane itself is doing great, the KLX135 finally died so searching out a replacement for that one BUT the big news is that I have moved airports from KEQY to KLKR and that's because I have been able to finally get a shadeport/hangar spot!

My airport neighbor also happens to have a Stearman and he offered to take me up and let me try my hand at flying one.  You don't realize how big those planes are until it's sitting next to yours, they are absolutely massive airplanes.

I am really likely my new home as it is less busy without the flight school and jet traffic, we've got a little group of guys that all coordinate and hang out at the airport.  This past weekend we spent the whole weekend eating pizzas and taking people up flying around the lakes and such and just in general having a great time.  

In other news I have put more time on the airplane in the past few months than I have since I owned the plane.  I actually did my first work trip in it back in July for a total of 2.5 hours which is farther than I have ever flown solo.  I feel like I am finally getting over my mojo back after my 2 incidents and now with the plane finally protected from the elements I can start working on getting it painted (after I get the KLX135 repaired)

Incidentally I did get a quote to paint it for 14 and 1/2 thousand dollars, which was quite an eye opener LOL

I just know that, as it stands, Im going to blow a bunch of money on aviation over the course of my life and it kind of makes sense to persue it in a fashion where it could potentially pay me back a little. 

If I sold all my gear right now, I could come up with 6k. Im about to pull the trigger on another 6k....

Or, is it a ""good luck"" thing because the job market is already saturated with qualified pilots that want those gigs? ""No one is going to hire an old fart that just payed for a CFI rating and has no experience beyond that.""

A little background information though. I've never had a DPE/DE because at my flight training school my Private and Instrument ratings were done ""in house"" meaning we had standardization instructors complete them and vouch for the school to the FAA saying I have successfully obtained my rating etc. I haven't had a checkride failure yet... my PPL certificate exam was the standard oral and flight (we actually got them scheduled on separate days so its less stress) and my instrument was an oral, simulator (majority of line items completed here), and a quick .5 flight. 

But however for the CSEL ride its going to be an in house as well as my first time experience with a DPE/DE. I did get a DPE/DE Gouge on the 2-3 DE's that the school utilizes but it would be helpful to have more information!

I'm pretty comfortable with the flying aspect. It's been relatively gusty conditions as well as clouds usually being broken/scattered at 3000 most days so getting out doing my maneuvers has given me a good bit of confidence... just the oral part (and maybe 8's on Pylons) that scare me a bit.

A small backstory, I worked a job in Enterprise IT for 10 years.  I saved up close to 100K, and decided to quit and pursue flight training full time for a career change.  I moved from the PNW to Sunny Florida so I could train full time.  That involved selling my house, and all kinds of stress.  

Time:  7 Months.  Cost:  16K.  I wasted 4 months at a terrible flight school that took my money and time.  Once changing flight schools to a professional outfit, everything was smooth and flowed as expected.

The Oral:  1.5 Hours.  92 on Written.

Was weird.  I was expecting scenario based down the ACS.  The DPE just said:  The Scenario is your cross country.  That's the last time there was a scenario based anything mentioned.  Instead of putting me at ease, he spent about 10 minutes making fun of his prior applicants.  This was off putting, but, I just listened and nodded.  

The biggest tip I can offer here, STOP and think before saying anything.  I was used to doing mock orals so I would just say the first thing on my brain.  95% of the time it was right, but if not my instructor would correct me.  Don't do that on your Oral.  The DPE might not let you know you are wrong.  

1.  Privileges &amp; Limitations.  Nothing out of the ordinary here, although he did like I had looked up the required hours to pull Gliders, or work as a aircraft sales. 

2.  Systems.  He wanted to know everything about the engine down to the oil separator that cools it.  My school has G1000s so I was also required to know the Ess Bus, the entire G1000 systems (drew it), and then we started going over the rest of the plane.  Systems was very very thorough and took up most of  the oral.

3.  VFR Sectional:  I thought I was ready, and man he humbled me pretty quick.  I was going UMMMM, but then something clicked and I got back on track.  What caught me off guard was he asked all questions that no one ever asked in mock orals.  


  A:  How to find traffic pattern altitude just looking at VFR Sectional.

  B:  Best way to get SVFR clearance from non-controlled flying into a Class D w/ operating tower.  He told me the best way is to call the tower on the ground, so they can sequence you in.  VS getting in the air and calling them.  

  C:  FSS!  OMG.  I was told this a new special emphasis area, so he grilled me.  Thankfully I had watched the FLY8Mate advanced sectional knowledge video and it got me through.  However I would recommend working with your CFI and making sure you understand all the things they can offer.  

 D:  Another 15 minutes on Class E &amp; Class G.  AGAIN, these where not questions I got in any practice oral.  He was giving me weather clearances and I would write them down, think about it, then answer.  


Flight:  I think this is the most important advice I can give for the entire check ride.  You don't need to be perfect.  But you need to be Safe.  

For clearing turns we where running low on time, so he told me one set was enough.

For the simulated engine out I was always told to circle over the Field you plan on landing.  DPE said there is nothing wrong with that, but if you have the altitude, speed, and a grass strip or better just fly the normal traffic pattern starting at downwind.   We got down to 50FT when he told me to go around.  I thought for sure we where landing on the grass haha.  My instructor was watching on FlightAware and also thought we landed on the grass.

The DPE chained all the manoeuvres together seamlessly.  

Before I knew it we where back at the airport doing the short field / soft field.  His only critique was for Soft field ride a bigger wheelie.  I've been training to add power before touchdown, and he was more about just bringing it in flare and riding the wheelie.  I'll need to work on that.  

Shortfield is my bread and butter, and he said I nailed it down to commercial standards.

Overall, I'm really glad it's over haha.  Get to start IFR next week.  I booked a plane from the school for Sunday.  I'm going to take my dad to get a $100 hamburger.

257,Private to Instrument or Commercial,"I have been tossing around the idea of going after an instrument rating to push me back into flying. I love it I just don't go nearly enough.  I've been flying sporadically for the last 10 years but never more than 10 hours a year. I find it difficult to usefully fly and plan around vfr weather at home, destination, and in between. I also hear an instrument rating is one of the best things a pilot can do to increase their confidence and overall safety. That's a huge selling point to me. 

I then thought why not keep going and hammer out a commercial license? It would be pretty cool, I think, to fly part time doing who knows what. The thought of flying and having a purpose really draws me in. You can only poke holes in the sky for so long. Long term goal: I don't particularly want to fly as a main source of income, but some side money wouldn't be bad. And I'm getting to fly on some one else's dime!

262,Really dumb new guy has a dilemma,"Hi all,

Long time lurker, first time poster. Been a flight simmer all my life (FS2004, FSX, Prepar3d, Falcon, BMS) and now I'm deep into the process of applying for Navy OCS for a naval aviator slot. ASTB scores 62 8/7/7. I want to be a pilot, either military or airline. I just want to fly and leave my desk job in IT.

My dilemma is simply this: I currently work full time, having just graduated college within the few years or so , on track to make slightly over six figures this coming year. No debt or anything, low rental costs, no dependents, etc. I just got lasers shot into my eyeballs a few weeks ago to improve my freaking horrible vision and have recovered nicely nearly 20/20 and what not. But there is a mandatory 6 month waiting period for the Navy after laser vision surgery and am afraid of getting medically DQ'd for discs that I herniated in my back last year while lifting at the gym. Recruiter says he can't even send me to medical in-processing until 6 months is up, and after that I'll have to go through the waiver process for both my eyes and the discs in my back.

I find myself thinking of flying every waking minute of my life, including at my soul sucking but high paying IT job. There is a great flying school in the area, and I don't want to spend the next year of my life just going to work every day sitting on my rear while waiting for Navy OCS to play out. I may get in or I may not. I may get medically accepted or DQ'd. I just don't know. That makes me want to start flying now, just in case I don't get into OCS or get pwned by NAMI or whatever.

So my question is this: Should I go ahead and blow money on getting a PPL and IR from said flight school while I wait for my Navy OCS process to go through? Even if everything goes as planned (e.g. go through medical waiver process, get medically qualified, get accepted by OCS board, get class date), I probably won't even leave for OCS until well into Q2/Q3 of 2020, if not even later (possibly 2021?...who knows). Or should I just hold out for another year and possibly let my rich Uncle Sam pay for it all?

273,Do I have a future as a professional pilot?,"I'm not sure where to begin here, so I'll start with my current status and work backward, I guess. Hopefully I'm inquiring to the right group.

I'm 30-ish, in good health, and live in a ~~shithole~~ rural American city about, let's say, three hours from a major international airport. My SO's somewhat niche career has pretty much anchored us to this town for the foreseeable future, so we cannot move closer to said international airport. I work as an aircraft mechanic (A&amp;P) at a non-union base for a regional airline. The work as an A&amp;P is all right, but base management is incompetent, and I find myself often loathing the thought of showing up to work each night. On the other hand, my paychecks are consistent, and I'm lucky that there is any work to be had as an aircraft mechanic here. Those I have spoken with at other maintenance bases seem to think a lot of the issues I encounter are local to our base, so I don't actually have a poor impression of the company overall.

However - I hold a commercial multi-engine license, instrument rating, et cetera, with about 250 hours of flight time. I have not flown, though, pretty much since I earned my bachelor's degree in aviation in 2013. During my flight training, I'd describe myself as an average pilot. I'm not current in any regard. This makes me sad.

There's a possible path to being a professional pilot within my company. I think that I need some wisdom to help sort out my thoughts, however.

* My company has a cadet program that leads to a position as a first officer. The nearest location that I can work within this program is near the international airport, about three hours away. I'd probably need to find a crash pad (probably poor phrasing), and see my SO on weekends. I assume this would last a couple years if I was able to fly enough. I don't think living apart during the week for much longer than that would be conducive to a healthy relationship or fiscally responsible.
* Before I could benefit from this cadet program, I'd need to get current ($) and earn my CFI (more $). The cash could be scrounged up, but I'm not sure how people go about getting current in the first place after the greater part of a decade Earthbound. Just trying to read an approach plate is like a foreign language at this point.
* Assuming I get current, accrue the necessary flight time, and meet the hiring requirements, I have no idea how airline life works. I would hope that there is some assurance that I could be based at the international airport nearby. I'm unsure if a three-hour commute by car (or several-time daily flights, employee standby) would cut it as a reserve pilot (which I assume is what new FOs are assigned). I do not know about the industry enough to understand all of the nuances or terminology, but it seems most pilots live much closer to their base and are more able to relocate.

I know that I'm missing various points, and I'm not really sure what my questions are, per se. I'm mostly trying to put my ideas out there get the *honest* thoughts of those more experienced that myself. Is this something that I should do? Does my living situation preclude being an airline pilot? Should I look at the cadet program? If not is it worth pursuing gainful employment as a pilot anywhere, or do I try to be the best A&amp;P I can be and try to improve the situation around me?

277,Flair Change: earned my CPL!,"So to start with, for some reason I can’t seem to change my flare in this community but hopefully I will have an answer to that soon. I am proud to report that after a very long day the other day, I was successfully able to complete my commercial pilot checkride exam.

Part of the issue at the start of my exam was whether the examiner would allow me to take my commercial checkride in a piper warrior that was not a technically advanced aircraft.  I had the required 10 hours of training and had combed regulations to find out if there was any restriction on the aircraft required. After posting in this forum several months ago, the resounding answer was that you needed only a VFR aircraft for the test. After checking regulations 61.129 and 61.45, I pointed this out to the DPE.  He responded via email and cited some advisory circular that was somewhat ambiguous. When I arrive to take my test, I panicked when I realized this plane that I had booked did not have a digital primary flight display. After talking with the examiner for approximately an hour and having three other people gently massage the issue, the DPA finally relented and decided to allow me to take the test in the Piper.  Long story short for this subject is that if you need clarification on any regulations, I recommend reaching out to the FSDO in advance and having them clarify so your DPE cannot cite otherwise.  The regulations can be confusing at best and sometimes straight legalese at worst.  Regardless, I didn’t want to start my check ride by having a legal throwdown with the examiner and I’m grateful that this issue was able to be diplomatically resolved without any ruffled feathers.

As for the oral itself, it was pretty painless. The great thing about using the same examiner for multiple rides over the past year is that they already know what type of pilot you are.  He did not cover redundant questions that they have asked several. times in the past with you.  It seems that half the battle in these things is just proving to your examiner that they have nothing to worry about, that you are a competent pilot and you know what you are talking about.  Besides getting caught up in some high altitude operation questions that I was vaguely familiar with, everything else was pretty easy.

After the oral, this is when the fun really begins. The Internet wasn’t working at the FBO, which means we had to access my application and pilots bill of rights using my cell phone.  After finally getting out to the airplane, suddenly the flaps had a problem and were not retracting. I had to scramble around the airport to find a mechanic to apply lubrication to the cable.Once I finally handle that problem we took off without a hitch. There was another plane from our flight school in the vicinity, and I was very grateful that they allowed me to have the practice area all to myself.  We did slow flight, power on stalls, power off stalls, accelerated stalls, all uneventful. 

When we finally moved to the eights on pylons, that’s when things got interesting.  I selected several pylons that were a little too close together. As a result we were constantly slicing around the air in circles but I was able to get it done nonetheless. The examiner then let me choose between doing the lazy eights or chandelles.  I had previously read that some examiners will offer you the choice and then make you do the opposite of what you just chose. Thankfully this was not the case and I gladly chose the chandelles as a result.  Unfortunately I reached my minimum airspeed at 90° instead of 180°, however the examiner subtly pointed this out and I attempted it again with no issue.  We did steep spirals and returned to the airport for our landings.  Short field landing on the numbers, power off 180° landing where I touched down right at the aiming points, and finally a soft Field landing to top off the check ride.

We taxied to the gate, shut down the engine and the DPE informed me that I was the proud owner of a new commercial pilots certificate.

Overall, I am very happy to finally have achieved this goal which was several years in the making. Why I’m taking a brief pause to enjoy this moment, I plan on hopping right back in and getting my CFI done in the next several months.  My road towards being a professional pilot is halfway done. I can’t wait to reach the real starting point where I go forth and help train pilots while increasing my knowledge and building my hours at the same time.

On another note, I get a surreal feeling when I fly myself somewhere, especially somewhere I'm familiar with, that I shouldn't actually be there because I didn't go past all the usual landmarks and pass the usual time in the car.  It feels like a dream while I'm there.  

Yet another note, small airports are still these magical places to me (I didn't grow up going to them at all), and when I'm at one there's some kind of excitement like I'm somewhere out of my usual comfort zone but in a good way.

288,Cadetship Maths Preparation,"Hello everybody, hoping to get some advice or tips off anyone who has gone through (or knows anyone who has) a cadetship, either commercial or military! (Also, I tried r/aviation with no luck so if this is against guidelines I'm sorry and please remove!)

A bit of context...

I'm in my early twenties and just out of college, I completed my bachelor's and master's in two non-technical fields.  

It was only recently, where I had the chance to sit in on a flight in the jumpseat of an A321 and then take an introductory lesson in a Cessna 152, that I've realised I really really want to pursue a career in aviation. It was always something I always thought about but now it is confirmed.

Recently I got through to the last stages of a highly competitive cadetship, unfortunately I did not get through to the medical but it was a great learning opportunity and a huge eye opener. This process involved psychometric and personality apptitudes as well as a 2 v 1 interview.

It’s a great minimum viable plane that, if it’s in fine mechanical order, suits my mission perfectly without costing much. It’s obviously old, and has ~5k TT and ~1500 SMOH. It’s a tired plane and I get that that’s part of a cheap price, I have been seriously looking for a year and a half so have learned most of the lessons you need to learn by the point. Anyways, it was about 26F at the field yesterday morning and the owner said there was no way we’d get it to start without plugging in the engine block heater (it’s in a tie down on the tarmac). Is that about right? He seemed to think anything below freezing would require a pre warming. Is that an early “tell” that something else is up or is that normal? When I did winter flying in 172s we rarely had them plugged in if ever. Shouldn’t change much to an answer but the owner put in a skytec 149. 

If the engine block heater *is* a necessity for a lot of cold weather ops, how do you folks deal with it if you don’t have a hangar? Drag the plane by hand halfway down the field?

331,Endorsement question about ASEL Add-on for PPL Glider.,"Hello everyone, 

I am a little confused about one specific scenario and wanted hear your opinion. I called FSDO and try to get a clear answer but it just confused me even more. 

Lets say a person came to you with a Glider PPL and wanted to ASEL Add-On. As far as I understand;

1) This person is NOT a student pilot and don't need a TSA endorsement or student pilot's licence.

2) Student only requires 30 hours instead of 40, because he/she can carry some of the Glider flight hours under total flight hours section. If the Glider Instructor was also CFI-A, he/she can even carry some of the dual hours for satisfying the 20 hour dual requirement. (FSDO answer)

3) This person is already a certificate holder so Student Pilot Endorsements for solo is not required. Instead this person will need 61.32(d)2 endorsement for solo flights.

The thing confuses me is, FSDO told me that even after giving 61.32(d) endorsement, I would still have to give Solo XC endorsements of 61.93(c)(1) and (2) and 61.93(c)(3) as well as 25nm endorsement 61.93(b)(1).

My questions are;

1) Why PPL holder would require any student pilot endorsement for XC?

2) If this person requires a XC endorsement even though he/she holds a certificate, why Pre-Solo Aeronautical Knowledge 61.87(b) is not required? Person will fly a different aircraft class for the first time and 61.87 exam covers airplane specifics. 

3) Is 61.32 overrides the other 3 pre-solo endorsements we would normally give to a student? (Pre-solo Aeronautical, Pre-Solo Flight Training and Solo Flight for Make/Model)

Does anyone have any input or experienced anything like this? Can you guys please let me know what would you do in this scenario and what do you think would be the required endorsements?

My write up thoughts...,"I am writing this in hope to read it in the future and giggle at my frustration/insecurity/challenges...If you have any recommendations, feel free to share. At this point it was my third flight and I have 4 hours at the end of today, also my second flight was ""rough"" - I had a different CFI who threw some aggressive stalls in and had me do a few -- I was not ready for that.

I am a student pilot working towards my private certificate. Today we did some slow turns, steep turns, stalls, etc., and then planned to do two touch and goes, then one full stop. 

So....

My CFI contacts tower and gets approval for touch and goes as we are wrapping up our maneuvers. Then I hear someone at taxi call tower for permission to take off and look down - there are 4, F18s (I think) lined up and get approved by tower ""if they can get out of our way in time"", they agree and take off. My CFI says ""okay be ready for some wash as we get close"" ... wow, he was right. We were all over the map coming in, landed slightly right of center and not too rough. First touch and go a success.

Coming around next time we look at the clock and realize we need to make this one a full stop. So my CFI tells tower full stop, tower approves and says we're two behind two larger planes (737 and a RJ) - tower asks us to make a 360 on the downwind...so we comply. As I am finishing my loop tower says we need to make another loop staying on the downwind to get the RJ in....so we comply. FINALLY, we get on base -  I did a poor job of lining up for final and HOLY HOT COW...the wash from the larger planes is throwing us all over. We landed only slightly rougher and further down than the jets did - in hopes to avoid some of their wash, I think - but it was tough AF to keep that 172 lined up coming in.

345,I declared an emergency today,"I need a lot of PIC XC hours before I qualify for the IR checkride. For my flight today (in a C150), I decided to go visit my old flight school at their new digs at KDWH and say my last goodbye to Weiser Airpark, which was closed permanently on November 4th.

I picked up a VFR flight following and climbed up to 7500’ for my cruising altitude, with nary a cloud to be seen all the way to the horizon. After a little less than 20 minutes at cruise, the engine RPM started to fluctuate. My first thought was that I might have leaned the mixture too far so I enriched the mix a couple of notches. When that didn’t work I checked the fuel selector, which was still fully in the on position. All the while, the fluctuation was getting worse. In the less than minute since it had started, the fluctuation had grown from ~100 RPM to over 1000 RPM. Not good.

I declared an emergency with Waco approach, and the controller got me headed towards Hillsboro and got a pilot closed to the airport to relay the emergency in progress over CTAF while I continued to attempt to stabilize the engine, now slowly losing altitude.

Seemingly out of ways to stabilize the engine, I scanned the panel... and realized I never pulled carb heat. *PULLS.* Almost immediately, the engine was completely back to normal, making full power consistently.

Still a little unsure of what exactly went wrong but mostly convinced the problem was caused by carb ice, I figured I would be okay continuing on to Houston and advised the controller that it seemed to be carb ice and I thought I could continue on. His “are you sure?” response (I wasn’t 100% sure) made me decide to keep flying towards Hillsboro for ~5 minutes just to make sure it didn’t start again.

5 minuted came and went without any problems and I had gained back all the altitude I lost, so I cancelled my emergency declaration and turned back south towards Houston. The rest of the flight and the entire return flight back to Spinks were completely uneventful with the engine working completely normally.

**ANALYSIS**

If I was in this situation again you can bet I would have handled it differently. For one, it wasn’t until after I pulled carb heat and resolved the problem that I even considered looking at the emergency checklists. For another, my desire to turn back south the moment the engine cleared up was definitely fueled by get-there-itis and was really dumb.

I wasn’t mentally prepared for an emergency in the slightest. By the time it happened, I’d relaxed into a role of letting the plane itself on trim while I scanned for traffic.

I'm preparing to get current on my PPL and ran into a minor hiccup while refreshing my aeronautical knowledge. Here's my question:

Why does the maneuvering speed decrease, when weight decreases? It seems to me that the lighter the plane, the faster you could be flying while making maneuvers without over-stressing the aircraft.

358,Right seat what do you do?,"Today flying with a friend of mine for first time.  He’s a 100 hr pilot, first time in type aircraft, he’s good, but like myself still learning a lot.  Me, ~1400 hrs with about 300 hrs in this airplane.  He’s flying we are doing some pattern work, I’m working flaps cause it’s an old school 150 that you have to hold the switch on.  

He’s landing safely, but can tell he is not 100% confident in controls of aircraft being a low wing guy.  On departure from a touch and go, after I get flaps up and glance at oil guage, I noticed it is on the low psi side, below the green.  We are just 5-10 feet off the ground at this point, with about 2000 feet of runway remaining.  I quickly second guess are we good to go?  In this instance I knew I had enough runway to set it back down, and pre flight briefing included I am PIC and in any emergency I’ll take controls, and fly the aircraft, I said my controls and took control of the aircraft and landed straight ahead with no issues.   Nothing abnormal noted on inspection, oil was right where it was when we departed, I added a quart and ran it again and run up and everything was good so continued flight with no issue and final landing of the day oil was same spot with maybe .25 quart burned after about 3.5 hrs.

My questions from the experts, and Monday morning quarterbacks is,   Did I do the right thing taking over controls or would a better option have been call for an aborted takeoff?  I have only ever aborted 3 takeoffs, and other two were me as pilot flying, never thought about it if I am sitting in the right seat letting someone else fly my plane.  I always like to after action review my flights, and this is one I am torn on, did I make the right and safest call?  If it happened again would I do the same thing?  And what would you do?

My thought process was, is this worth aborting for, yes.  Do we have room to land, yes if you take immediate action.  Is my friend able to land if I call abort, not sure.  Do I act as pic and make the abort call happen, yes I know I can and am confident in my ability.

372,Engine Failure in the Mountains!,"The situation happened a few months back, and I think this is a good place to share it. I am a flight instructor and just about to start at the airlines, I believe I had around 900hrs when this occurred. I was flying in the mountains with 2 passengers on an hour long scenic flight. We were in a 172xp, it was a calm morning extremely smooth and not a cloud around (perfect for sightseeing).  For those who don’t know an XP is just a 172 with more power and a constant speed prop so it does better with weight and altitude. After about 45 minutes I was making my way back towards the field descending out of about 3,500 agl just coming out of the mouth of a canyon. The power was back and I was keeping an eye on all engine instruments making sure not to shock cool the larger 6 cylinder engine. With no indication my engine just starts losing power, at first I assumed my mixture was still just to lean, within a few seconds I realized I was engine out when there was no response with power change. Then oil pressure dropped down. I Pitched for Vg about 70 and shot straight towards the runway. As I made a quick flow through the cockpit starting down at the fuel selector and then working my way up and to the left I realized everything was as it should be (prop was still windmilling). I made a quick call over the airports Unicom to make a straight for the runway that I was mostly setup on. I only had about 6 or 7nm to glide for a straight in and luckily winds where calm still. I ended up being a bit high and instead of diving I just made some s turns until I had the runway made. This plane seems to drop a lot more quickly than a normal 172, more like a 182. I waited a while and finally put it 20 degrees of flaps and made it on the ground with out any extra issues. The only other step I could have used was feather the prop, but I decided just to leave it spinning. I had a lot of altitude, but should have just used it to get a slightly better glide. One thing that I think helped was letting the passengers know immediately what had happened and then reassuring them we would make the runway. Went about as smooth as possible and I had been thinking about it a bit in the descent just to plan ahead. Still caught me off guard when there was no indication just like someone had pull the mixture or turned off the mags.
       As any emergency I was very glad everyone was ok but also rather anxious wondering if I had missed something in the preflight. After a few weeks we found out there was a dual magneto failure. A washer had come loose somewhere and ground down the gears connecting the mags to the accessory gearing. This seems like a rather rare failure but still an interesting and serious one none the less. If this happened maybe 5 minutes prior I would have been right over some very tall peaks. I teach mountain flying as well and practice giving students engine out situations at similar spots to where I was and seeing how they handle it and if they can make the runway.

378,First solo!,"Hi All. Contributing my obligatory first solo post, albeit a little over a month late.

I have been working towards my PPL since late July and have been enjoying every moment (although, I am getting tired of 'Right rudder!' being repeated in my ears). After completing the standard maneuvers, we started pattern work for the landings. I found this part of the training really intense as it really requires you to juggle multiple items at the same time. I found that as I was talking to tower, my altitude would change too much, or as I was banking, my line would be off, altitude too low, and speed too high, etc...

So, after five lessons of pattern work, I had completed my written knowledge exam and my CFI asked me to purchase insurance, which I did. So, I was getting pumped for my first solo. Well, on a Friday, I was thinking it might happen, and we went up to do pattern work. For the first landing, he kept quiet the entire pattern and my first landing was pretty good (I thought), until we finished our touch-and-go, and he asked where was my second notch of flaps on base before the landing.  8|  The second landing was by far the worst I had ever done and it really rattled me, so much so that after my next bad landing, my CFI offered to do one to demonstrate and let me calm down. Of the next five landings I did, three were terrible, and two were awful. So we did a full stop to end for the day and I was pretty deflated. He told me to learn from it as we all have bad days, but I think he was trying to not hurt my confidence any more. 

So, two days later, on Sunday, we had time booked again. I had spent all Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday morning feeling pretty down but thinking over the prior Friday in my head. There was a pretty strong wind with a decent cross wind, so, as I was pre-flighting the aircraft, I figured we'd  just do more pattern work and the solo was off the table. Well, we went up and the first two landings were pretty solid, so when we were midfield downwind on the third, he said he'd do the radio call and told the tower it would be a full stop so I could solo. I was gobsmacked. I honestly thought there was a 0% chance of my soloing that day, so when he made that call, I couldn't believe my ears.

I made the landing (pretty good) and we taxied back to the ramp. He gave me some pointers (smooth on controls, GUMPS, stick to checklist, do radio calls, etc...) and he was off to watch from the tower. So, I did the checklist, made my calls, and when I went to take off, the plane practically jumped off the runway with just me in it! I made pattern altitude upwind where I usually made it turning downwind, but I adjusted and talked all of my steps out loud to myself. My first two landings (stop and taxi back) were pretty good, but my third I bounced it slightly (not too bad) and I was so thrilled to have completed my first solo! As tower was giving my taxi instructions, he told me congrats on my first solo and that I did a good job, which was really nice to hear on the radio. 

I made it back to the ramp and the CFI and front office attendant (recent PPL himself) showed up with the scissors. I was happy I wore an older shirt, which was soaked in sweat (late September in Texas), so I felt a little bad as my CFI was cutting through the sweat of my shirt. You can see my excitement in the picture none-the-less. Well, as that was the only shirt I had (didn't plan on soloing that day), I got to walk through the FBO, which was unusually busy that day, of course, in all of my sweaty, fresh-solo glory.  :)

I just finished my solo cross countries and one night flight, so I'm charging ahead!

382,TIFU: VFR into IMC at night,"So I messed up. I got away with it, but I messed up. I get anxious thinking about it, so I thought maybe i'd share it here. Might help someone else one day to stay on the ground, might help me too.

After visiting some friends about 80 miles away, it was time to head home. A cold front was passing through from the west to east and with it brought thunderstorms and rain, then low ceilings. Although my friends offered me to stay the night, I assured them that this front would pass soon and i'd be on my way shortly.  There was no real pressure to get home, but I didn't want to impose on my friends and their young family, so I figured I'd wait it out at the airport. Sadly, by time I got there, the FBO was closed, so I ended up doing a pre-flight and hanging out in the plane. Hours passed as the front passed slowly! 

It got late and I was getting annoyed as both MOS and TAF forecast kept changing, and a persistent low ceiling stuck around. Worse yet, as my departure airport became MVFR, my destination airport would turn back to IFR and vice versa. SAT was showing the system slowly moving East (my flight was basically a straight 270 heading for 80 miles) . Although there were no other airports with weather reporting between my departure and destination airports direct line, there were reports from about 40 miles north and 30 miles south of my track. At last my destination was reporting scattered \~3000 becoming unlimited ceilings. My departure was indicating 3000 OVC. Looking at the sat, the weather was moving out and destination temp/dew point spread was favourable enough where chances of fog were low. Time to go.

Although I am night current, I am not IFR rated. I have some instrument training, but certainly none in actual IMC at night! I have about 300hours, of which 40 in type, a single engine high performance retract. My personal VFR minimum is (was) 3000ft AGL (though never differentiated between day and night..)

I figured I would take off, turn north to follow a major highway for a bit before turning west, this would give me a wide clearance around a pair of 2000+ft towers.  I decided to rotate at a little higher speed than normal to give the plane time to shed all the water on it, I had plenty of runway. 

I climb out at Vy, turn left heading north and then west on course, autopilot is set to heading mode, I look down at the HSI, crosscheck with compass, and before I know it I am in IMC, at night. fuck! I also blew right past my 3000ft planned altitude, but I am certain that the ceiling was lower than expected I leveled off at roughly 3500 and tried to focus on instruments. I had a hard time focusing which I attributed to the nav, taxi, and strobe lights flashing (duh). I turned those off, that helped. I remembered that I was still at takeoff power so set a quick and dirty cruise power setting. It got really bumpy and I had a hard time maintaining a set altitude. Suddenly I remembered that the aircraft has Alt hold ( I use this on every single flight btw, I simply forgot..). 

I got heading and altitude now secured, but the airplane sounded louder than normal. Maybe all of the adrenalin made me more sensitive, but I was afraid that I was accelerating, the instruments did not seem to indicate anything though. Alt was steady and speed was steady. It was bumpy however and I just couldn't shake the feeling that I was going too fast. I set power to a lower setting, which then made the AP yell for trim compensation. I set trim for this lower speed. 

I am now aware of my heart racing. Not seeing anything that can kill me right off the bat, I try to take some deep breaths to calm down. I am in solid IMC, at 3500ft, I am heading towards my destination as verified by GPS and compass. I know that if I fly long enough, I will break out, I saw it on the satellite. It is all clear further west. I just have to not fuck up any further. I start thinking about embedded cells. I try to stop thinking about that.

I consider descending to 3000 again to see if I can break out, but at this point I start seeing glimpses of the moon and stars above in between a broken cloud layer, while still solid clouds below. I decide to not mess with the plane's altitude. I don't want to go back down and potentially lose control. I keep going west. Solid IMC turns into a broken mix, though below there is nothing but clouds. I see the 2000ft radio towers that I was avoiding, but only their top beacons. GPS tells me I am flying over my hometown, I see the glow of the town, but still overcast below me. 

It looks like between my departure OVC3000 and destination SKC3000, there was some solid low IFR fog (in fact, the same LIFR that had previously covered my destination had naturally moved east). At this point I have calmed down enough to where I increase power again. I just want to get home. About 10 miles from my destination,  Broken turns to scattered, turns to clear.  I land under a clear sky.  I put the plane away, get in my car and go home. 

I get out of my car at home (where I flew over earlier in IMC), I look up and I see fucking stars. It f'in figures.. 

Had I waited another hour or two, it would have been a clear and beautiful night flight. 

Causal factors: 

\- failure to fully interpret weather information to make extrapolations between reporting stations. 

\- lack of patience

Survival Factors:

\- Autopilot

\- Prioritizing keeping the airplane flying straight and level, vs attempting to duck under the clouds, or return to departure airport. I elected to continue flight into IMC due to being a stable course with plenty of fuel (time). I did not want to return to departure airport as I did not want to load an instrument approach while mentally taxed, and figure out how to fly it as a VFR pilot in IMC. I was too scared of consequences to ask ATC for help. 

Although I stand by my first decision to continue into IMC, I own the fact that I should have communicated with ATC and get all the possible assistance available.

387,I designed a new VFR Nav Log,"A little background... I'm an Art Director/Graphic Designer by trade, and started my PPL training about 5 months ago. Since I've started working with the standard VFR Nav Logs, I've been imagining the possibility of making them better.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=13RH8TAP8ys710vk5m55t8wV51nU6SPqh](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13RH8TAP8ys710vk5m55t8wV51nU6SPqh)

There were 3 goals that I wanted to address in this endeavor...

1. **Prioritize the flight information** \- I always wind up folding my nav logs in half to make them fit in my kneeboard, but then they become unusable without unfolding. I knew there must be a way to shift the ""non essential"" data to one side of the page, so the pilot could fold the page, and only see the essential info.
2. **Emphasize Magnetic Course over Magnetic Heading** \- Most of the other nav logs I've used have you add the wind correction to True Course first, to find the True Heading and then Magnetic Heading... But if I want to use a VOR, or want to verify my GPS ground track, I need the Magnetic Course (True Course + Mag. Variation).
3. **Add in some missing essentials** \- Some nav logs don't have spaces for the total range of the aircraft. I think that's essential to know for any flight, and worth writing down.

389,Stabilized approach question,"So I have my instrument check ride tomorrow, and after doing some final review I’ve realized the way my CFI-I has taught me to fly the approaches is not technically stable. In the sr-20 there are flaps 50% and flaps 100%. The way he has taught me is to fly down to minimums with flaps 50% and at 100 knots. Upon breaking out then add the final notch of flaps and slow to 80 kts for landing. His rationale is that if you fly the approach at flaps 50% and have to go missed there is less changing of configuration than if you have flaps 100% out, and if you pop out and feel you don’t want to add that last notch of flaps (runway length permitting) you can just land it flaps 50%. I’ve never felt rushed or unstable getting the last notch of flaps out, slowing, and stabilizing power/trim before touchdown, but I am not nearly as experienced as many of you are. I would really appreciate feedback not only on how to handle this on my check ride tomorrow, but also in terms of real world flying if you guys think this is an unsafe method.

390,CFI Lesson Plans?,"Long story short, per my flair I'm only a private pilot. The day before my commercial checkride I was told by an AME my medical was no longer valid. Working on getting a special issuance and of course it's now taking even longer than expected. So I decided rather than just waiting around I'd use the extra time to study for my CFI rating as well. Prior to this whole incident I was actually planning on skipping CFI altogether and going job-hunting, but as you can see the situation changed, so here I am.

Anyway, I'm told the bulk of preparation for the CFI checkride, other than the written, is making all your lesson plans. I know you can buy them as well but I'm sure making your own is more beneficial to your own knowledge. I'm going to be working with an instructor but I was told to get the written out of the way first, which is what I'm currently working on. But in preparation for the next stage I was hoping all you CFI redditors could shed some light on the process for me.

How exactly should I format these lesson plans? What are the main resources I should be referencing? Just the AFH, PHAK, and FAR/AIM? Or do you guys have any other suggestions? I was told by the instructor I talked to that you'll basically end up with a big binder full of lesson plans. Do you guys actually reference/read from your physical lesson plans when you teach? Or is the information so ingrained in you that you don't need to? Finally, when it comes time for the checkride, are you allowed to just bring all those lesson plans with you or do you have to have all of it memorized well enough to teach from the top of your head?

393,Engine Failure: Pull Carb Heat!! Am I wrong here?,"So with the recent posts regarding engine failures, rough running, reduced power etc, I have noticed carb heat doesn't seem to be receiving much attention. Maybe these have been in fuel injected aircraft; it is possible I have not read carefully enough... BUT assuming these are carburetors, my instructors always drilled the *first* reaction to suspected loss of power or a rough engine should be pulling carb heat on. Here's why I think that is the best initial course of action.

1) Carb ice takes time to clear. The time to clear depends on the severity of the icing, but chances are the engine will not be running well during the clearing process due to the water passing through the engine. You can troubleshoot other possible causes in the mean time. Having the heat on will not hurt if it ends up being something else! 

2) Outside of mechanical failures, carburetor ice is one of the few things that can cause sudden or immediate loss of power (empty tanks being another!). If your initial reaction in a loss of power scenario is to fuck with the mixture, it is worth remembering you can run a little rich or a little lean with barely a perceptible difference, but a little ice is a whole different story.

3) Pulling carb heat bypasses the normal air intake, giving you two possible fixes with the pull of one knob. The filter can become obstructed by bird feathers, sleet, Cirrus parachute panels or who knows what else. Carb heat provides alternate and hopefully unrestricted airflow to your engine, leaving you with fuel and spark as the next items to troubleshoot.

4) It takes half a second to pull. You should know where your carb heat is by feel and be able to pull it on or off without breaking your concentration out of the windscreen. Contrast that to watching RPMs and EGT as you adjust mixture, checking fuel tank indicators and selectors, turning mags on and off, checking oil temp and pressure etc. 

Remember, if it *is* an icing issue, you may only have half a second before there isn't sufficient airflow to keep the engine running. Once that happens, you're relying on a rapidly diminishing heat reserve to save the day without another backup solution.

I'd love to hear additional thoughts and why carb heat is or is not your first reaction!",flying,1573452895,De-Ril-Dil,45,1,True,2019-11-11

399,"I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall, will I ever be able to complete my private pilot license?","I'm a 23-year-old female, with about 20 hours under my belt... old hours though. I started flying when I was 18 and took lessons for about three months, paying for it out of my own pocket, paycheck to paycheck from my retail job at the time. I had always wanted to be a pilot, ever since I was a little kid, and would have pursued it as a career but I come from a creative background, a family of architects, illustrators, writers, and filmmakers, and I wound up going to design school instead. As much as I loved flying with all of my heart, I felt like there wasn't enough opportunity for creativity (in terms of making) to satisfy me forever. 

Even though I was at 20 hours, I haven't soloed as I was really in need of some more back-to-back lessons to feel ready for that part, and as I was funding it myself, I couldn't afford the frequency. So, I never wound up going for the medical.

At the time, I would have probably passed it just fine.

However, I was just recently diagnosed with ADHD. This was more of an issue in my schooling because in my final year, it was a very open-plan curriculum, and for me, that's where I struggle the most. I don't work well unless I have tight deadlines, imposed by others and not by myself. I was prescribed Adderall during this time, which I am still taking, as it really helps me stay on track with my personal work and personal scheduling.

&amp;#x200B;

I do really hope to complete my pilot's license, but I understand that Adderall, and ADHD, can be disqualifiers. I feel like this is actually a dated mindset. For one thing, ADHD in women looks very different than it does in men, and we both deal with different challenges. Additionally, we all know that a lot of military pilots are given Modafinil to stay awake... which is not that dissimilar to Adderall. And once again, I am *very* good at adhering to rules, deadlines, and guidelines set by others - which is why I did quite well when I was flying, and studying when I was 18, it's a rigid system - especially the important things. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering, is it possible that I could still pass my medical, and still complete my license now? Has anyone else here dealt with this?

408,Skywest VS Envoy,"Skywest VS Envoy.

Hello aviators, I’m currently in the process of choosing a regional airline to fly for. I’ve done quite a bit of research on the regional airlines and the two that best fit my situation for me and my family are these two. I will lay out some of the benefits between these two then would love the opinions of you pilots on which you would choose and why. Or at least just your thoughts. Just for some background I’ll be working as a CFI and both these companies offer certain programs through the school I’ve gone through. 

Skywest.
1. Pay and benefits. As I will be working as a CFI Skywest will be giving me 500 a month in tuition reimbursement eventually equaling 11K. Also, the FO starting pay and later Captain pay is great but it’s about the same as Envoy so nothing really game changing there. 
2. They are the largest regional operator. With that comes a multitude of crew bases. Currently based on there seniority and base choices, the base I would be wanting to live at would be available to me within about 6 months of both FO and Captain later. Which makes life a whole lot easier when not commuting.
3. My long term goal is to get to Southwest. I’ve heard from many people that Southwest hires from Skywest the most because the pilots at Skywest have a great track record of safety and they mirror the values SW looks for. (Maybe it’s also Skywest has over 5K pilots so they just get the most applicants from there)
4. Skywest treats there employees really well. QOL when it comes to management and what not is apparently very great at Skywest.
5. I’ve heard Skywest looks good on any future application just because they have a great reputation with all there carriers. 
6. Skywest has a great training program. This is obviously really important when I’m starting and needing to really understand how to fly a jet and get rated. 

There’s probably many other great benefits but just for simplicity sake these are the ones I’ve narrowed to down to that would sway my opinion. 

Envoy. 
1. Pay and benefits. This one is actually very important and a major deciding factor. As I will be working as a CFI, Envoy offers you to basically become a Envoy employee while still building hours for your 1500. What that means is I would get health insurance for me and family, I’m a husband who will be having kids soon, flight benefits, 401k, and when you sign up they give you 5K up front that will go towards my tuition and another 5k after completing training. The health benefits are the most important because as working as a CFI they don’t offer me any benefits whatsoever and kids will be coming into the equation Over the next year. As far as the hourly pay goes they pay just a bit more then Skywest but not enough to where that would sway my opinion. 
2. Envoy is the wholly owned for American Airlines and you get to take advantage of there “Flow through program”. If I went to Envoy, the entry interview would be the last interview I would ever take at AA. They advertise that in about 5-7 years, based on seniority and availability, that you will move over to AA when a spot opens up. Again, I want to work for SW but it is good “life insurance” you could say while I’m still applying elsewhere. Also, who actually knows if those projected times to flow are at all accurate. 
3. I would most likely be flying an ERJ instead of a CRJ which would be nice. Just little perk. 
4. I would upgrade to Captain ASAP. This is either a good or bad thing. Envoy forces you to upgrade which is great pay wise but bad because you would lose the seniority for you base option. So with there current projections I would get stuck in LaGuardia for about 1.5 years before being able to choose the base I would want. 
5. I’ve heard corporate relationship with pilots at AA and Envoy is not great. I’ve heard some pilots say it’s just poorly managed all around making QOL poor in that regard. 

This is generally what I’ve narrowed it down too. The biggest benefit to going to Envoy is the health benefits while I’m working as a CFI. My wife would not be working while we have kids and for that reason health insurance would need to be coming in from somewhere and Envoy would be that. However, many of the other factors I’ve found such as Skywest great reputation, treatment of employees, crew base options, and so on make those long term goals and QOL seem better. 

I thank you for your patience if you’ve read this far. I could’ve made this longer but for sake of keeping someone’s attention I figured I would narrow it down. I would love to hear y’all’s input.

417,Flair Change: CFII - Short Write-Up Inside,"Hi all.

Just a quick write up about my CFII ride I completed over the weekend.  As most have said on here, it's probably the easiest checkride out there.  My examiner was very efficient in getting through all the tasks.

Met at 11:30 and did the usual paperwork/IACRA stuff which took about 30 minutes.

Oral consisted of going right down the PTS required tasks and he did it very efficiently.  A few questions here and there, but mostly just a discussion and some stories the examiner told about personal experience.  

Talked very briefly about weather: day before watch the weather channel, get an outlook briefing, get a standard briefing, make a go/no decision.  File a flight plan.

Touched on the Pitot/Static system: what instruments are they.  That was the only question.  He really enforced knowing your airplane.  Example, he sees too many private pilot applicants who have G5's to replace AI and HI, but they keep referencing the vacuum system.  This is not only a student problem, but also an instructor problem.  He cautions instructing in an airplane you are not familiar with.  Good Lesson.

Asked me the acronym for lost comms: A-V-E-F   M-E-A 

Talked about how to do an IPC by looking at the Matrix in the PTS/Instrument ACS.  He showed me how to do this, I was not asked anything about an IPC.

How long to keep logbook endorsements for students.

Asked when we can log an approach.

I quickly demonstrated how to brief an ILS approach.  He asked what the negative C meant (extended circling minimums) and what is required when we break out of the clouds for a circle to land.  Really nothing here you shouldn't already know.

&amp;#x200B;

Oral: Just over 1 hour

&amp;#x200B;

About a 15 minute flight to the airport where we were going to be doing approaches.  We talked about careers, what my plans were, what all he has flown, his joy of being an instructor/examiner.   

Got close to the airport, picked up our weather and asked ATC for our approaches.  

We got vectors for ILS followed by the published missed approach to a hold (1 lap).

Vectors for a VOR approach circle to land (full stop taxi back then departed back to home airport).

On the way back to the home airport we did 1 timed turn, 1 nose high unusual attitude and 1 nose low unusual attitude recovery (I walked him through how to recovery from each).  Returned for a visual landing at home airport.

&amp;#x200B;

Flight: 1.3

&amp;#x200B;

There is not much to write up, because, well there isn't much to talk about on this ride.  It is very straight forward and if you get a good examiner, it is a piece of cake.  I did do my due diligence though with regard to studying.  Just because everyone says it is an easy one, doesn't mean it will be.  I over prepared for this just like I do every checkride and that certainly helps calm the nerves.  If there are any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

I was pretty banged up at the time including, a Lefort (face) fracture, broken ribs, punctured lung, (had a chest tube) and lacerated liver and spleen. I have no complications of my injury and feel completely fine. My PCP, hospital, and AME all checked me off and said I was good to go, but not the FAA, so is there still hope for me or am I doomed by the FAA?

They say they will reconsider if I have ""significant medical evidence to offer."" They have all my records from my hospital and PCP. Who do I need to go see? An FAA approved neurologist? And do you know of anything I could write to the FAA that would convince them to overturn their denial once I have ""significant evidence?"" Im completely healthy, eat well and work out daily.

435,How accurate is this pesepestic perspective of airline pilot life?,"I ran across this reply to a comment on /r/flying the other day in response to someone who said pilots get paid to do a hobby:

&gt;Is your hobby wasting away in hotels 12-16 nights/month? Is your hobby paying $16 for a shitty salad in the airport or eating junk food or nothing at all because that's what's around? Is your hobby drinking alone on the holidays while you're stuck in Bumfuckassville on an overnight with a shit crew? Is your hobby spending half a day sitting in an airplane you aren't even flying just to get to work? Or maybe your hobby is picking up and moving your life because your airline closed your base on a whim? Maybe your favorite thing to do is constantly be doing online training and then going in the sim every 6 months to defend your job. Perhaps what you've always dreamed of is writing up coffee pots, kicking off drunk people, diverting for medical emergencies, getting delayed all day and then landing at 4am, only to get minimum rest and go do it again? Maybe you particularly enjoy having never gotten a good night's sleep for the last 6 years because of your constantly changing sleep cycle?
Get fucked. It's not a hobby, it's a job, and THAT'S the shit they pay us for, not pushing the buttons.

447,Commercial ASEL Checkride Passed - Writeup,"Happy to say that I passed my Commercial ASEL ride yesterday!  I figured I would provide a little writeup since I've always found these helpful.

About me: Going into the ride I had ~394 hours.  Did my PPL back in 2007 at 46 hours, didn't fly much for the next 8-9 years, and then instrument in 2017 at around 240 hours.  Been mostly doing IFR XC flights for the last 2 years, and it had really been since 2007 that I did more than a few VFR maneuvers.  (Really only on my BFRs)  I did half of my required complex dual time back in 2010 to get my complex endorsement, and about a year ago I did ~10 more hours in a Mooney M20F to get a checkout.  Passed the CAX written late last year with a 93, using Sheppard Air.  Using the same examiner as I had for my IR ride last time.

Oral: He had asked me to plan a flight to Savannah (SAV) from Orlando (ORL).  Him, plus one 200lb passenger, plus 60 lbs of bags, full fuel.  That put us about 20lbs under gross in the 172P that we were using for the test.  Started with what kind of paperwork to be able to do this flight legally.  Talked about my airman certificate, medical, photo ID, then talked about the usual Annual, etc, (A1TAPE, but AP not required since we are VFR), talked about the ADs.  What would we do if some equipment were inoperative?  I talked about what's required by 91.205, what's required for certification (POH), then how we would follow 91.213 to possibly placard and disable or remove some equipment.  He asked me if we had something that was required, so it made us illegal, but we could possibly fly safely without it, what could we do?  I mentioned we could probably get a ferry permit, for example to take the plane to get the maintenance done.

Then we talked about my XC.  What was the overall weather picture?  I said the weather looked like good VFR, no AIRMETs, no SIGMETs, good tailwind, although we would have a broken layer of clouds over much of the route, so we might need to do the flight lower than I had planned.  He asked about how I could get updated weather info in flight... talked about HIWAS, I mentioned I had ADSB-IN weather, could ask ATC, etc.  He asked if there were any NOTAMs, I mentioned that there were a few VORs out of service near our route but not on it.  He asked how much fuel we need for the flight and how long it would take.  Just about 20 gallons, planning 9 gal/hr and 105 kts as a conservative value.  I showed him how I had used some more pessimistic values from the POH and then rounded up.  He asked what power setting I needed for that.  I ballparked 2450rpm, and I double checked that with the POH for him.  I also showed him that our takeoff/landing performance would be well within runway lengths and so we'd be good there.  He asked how much fuel we need, I explained VFR fuel reserves, day and night.  I told him my personal minimum was planning to have 1 hour of fuel remaining, which gave us 3 hours of endurance with reserves for our 2 hour flight.  He asked me what if we delayed the flight 6 hours, is the weather still good?  I looked at the Progs with him and said it still looks good to me.  (Big high pressure over our area at the moment, probably good until tomorrow)

We talked a bit about the weight and balance.  What is the effect of us being near gross?  What would happen if he put the heavier person in the front instead of the back?  What if they both sat in the back?  How would each scenario affect our handing characteristics?  I mentioned how the aft CG would give us a bit better cruise performance at the expense of a bit of reduced pitch stability.  At either max, however, we were well within the center of the CG envelope.

Then we went over my route of flight, one place at a time.  He asked me about each airspace we would be in, what kind of VFR weather minimums we have in each.  For us, it was Class D, probably a class B, then a lot of class E, and ultimately a class C.  Asked me about Alert Areas, what are they.  I said I would treat them a bit like a MOA, head on a swivel, but we can go through.  Would prefer to be on flight following.  Finally up near SAV, he asked what we can do if we got there and the airport is closed due to an emergency on the field, where can we go?  I suggested we divert to Hilton Head (HXD) due to it being close and I was familiar with it.  He asked what happens if its 11pm?  I mentioned it's untowered then, but I would self announce.  He asked if there was fuel available?  I told him likely only while the FBO was open, so at night I might divert instead to an airport with a self-serve fuel, also nearby.

Then he asked me all about my commercial privileges, what kinds of things *can* I do, and then he posed a hypothetical scenario where he buys a plane and wants me to fly him around.  All good so far.  What if his family comes?  What if his friends?  Clients?  Business partners?  All good.  What if his clients go, but he's not there, and they pay for the flight.  I said this is getting to be a grey area, as long as they have legitimate business other than the flight it could be good, but it starts to appear shady.  He wanted to know could I go lease a plane for him and do the flights?  No.  What if he leased it because his plane was in for maintenance.  That's fine, as long as I had nothing to do with him getting the plane.

Then we talked briefly about flying at high density altitudes, hypoxia, oxygen requirements at altitude, and what we could do about sick passengers.  I mentioned the usual 12,5/14/15 rules.

Last, we talked very briefly about the systems of the 172.  He mainly wanted me to explain the fuel system, and how the induction works.  I explained that we have two fuel tanks, 40 gal usable, 43 gal total, they're connected by a vent, it's gravity fed to the engine, there's a fuel selector where the fuel lines join, then it goes to the carb.  I mentioned the primer bypasses the carb.  He asked about if there's any hazards associated with a carb?  I mentioned overpriming and potentially engine fires on start, and he asked me to explain that procedure.  Then I mentioned carb ice, and that our expected temperatures aloft might actually cause that to be a concern for our flight if we performed the XC.  He asked how to recognize carb ice in flight and what to do.

The flight: He gave me a detailed brief of the flight.  We would depart on our XC with a soft field takeoff, after 5 minutes or so, we would be unable to complete it, and need to divert.  I would need to tell him roughly the heading/distance/time/fuel to our divert airport.  Then we would head to a practice area of my choice, do airwork, then have a simulated emergency, then do some ground ref maneuvers, then fly to an airport of my choice and do a power off 180, a short field, and a soft field landing.

I preflighted the plane and before we stared I asked if he wanted a briefing.  He said consider me briefed.  I started up, did my instrument cockpit check, checked brakes, all the stuff I usually do.  We were going to depart VFR northwest, under the Bravo at 1400 feet.  I mentioned normally if we would do this XC I would ask for Flight Following and likely get into the Bravo, but in this case I had planned our XC to take us near the practice area below the Bravo.  He was ok with that.  We departed with a soft field takeoff, everything went fine there.  After a couple minutes he asked me how I planned to get there.  I mentioned I knew the magnetic course I needed to fly to the first point, and I would verify the point by seeing some major roads that joined there and a nearby airport.  Then he said, hey, I forgot something, my secretary will bring it to me up in Sanford, we need to go to Sanford.  I turned towards Sanford, plugged it into Foreflight, got a more refined course/distance/time/fuel number, told him.  He said, that works, let's go get setup for airwork.

I flew west to the Lake Apopka practice area, monitoring the practice area frequency.  Fortunately it wasn't too busy.  I got setup at 3000 feet, I did my pre-maneuver checklist, did my clearing turns, and self-announced.  First was slow flight.  For each maneuver he basically would say ""go ahead and maneuver as necessary and get setup for &lt;X&gt; maneuver, and let me know when you're ready"".  It was a little turbulent, so as I was slowing down I had the stall horn ding a bit, but I powered up and got it back above the horn.  Did one 90 degree turn to the left.  Then recovered.  Then it was a power on stall.  I mentioned that I had been clearing the area while we turned and he was ok with that.  So we went right into the power on stall, which was fine.  Then I turned us 180 back around to stay over the lake and clear us again, then we did a steep turn.  He let me choose the direction and I chose left.  It went ok, I probably banked a little too shallowly so I gained a bit of altitude.  After that we setup for a power off stall, again staying over the lake, so clearing the area.  That went fine.  Then a chandelle.  He let me choose the direction, and to avoid some clouds, I decided to the right would be best.  That went pretty good.  I overpitched slightly, so I got the stall horn for a second about 30 degrees before completion, but I eased up a tad and finished ok and recovered.  That left us at 3500 feet, and he asked me to show him an accelerated stall.  I slowed us to 90 kts (below Va), did my 45 degree right turn, and recovered promptly at the horn.

At this point he said ""This is a simulation, but I think I see some smoke from your cowling!""  I immediately started on the engine fire in flight checklist, closed the cabin vents, got turned towards land, pitched down and accelerated to Vno in the turn (since it was turbulent, not Vne), and simulated pulling the mixture and cutting off the fuel.  He said ok, I think the fire is out, where are we going now?  I pitched for glide and judged we were within gliding distance of a local strip called Orlando North (FA83), I headed for the midfield.  Got there at 500 feet above, decided my best course was a right 270 turn to join a right downwind for 9, as the winds were east.  The 270 turn burned 300 feet of what I needed, which put us close enough to a downwind for a normal power off 180.  I threw in 10 degrees flaps and did my normal power off approach, which in the 172 is a pretty tame affair that almost resembles a normal pattern.  Was just a bit high coming up on final so I intentionally overshot a bit so I could come back to it and burn a bit more, then I threw in one more notch flaps and a few seconds of slip, which put me right where I needed to be.  Landed about 100 feet beyond the start of the pavement.  He said lets make this one a touch and go, and we'll count that as your power off 180.

Then it was back up for 8s on pylons... spent a few minutes scouting for pylons, chose them, then looked at my pivotal altitude cheat sheet, and got setup to enter downwind.  Did them, they went ok, then he said lets just go get the soft and short field landings, and the short field takeoff.   I elected to head back to Orlando (ORL) for those.  He let me choose which I wanted to do first, I elected to do the soft field first, to a full stop taxi back.  That went fine, then we did a short field takeoff, stayed in the pattern for a full stop.  I elected to fly final at 55 kias for the short field because we were a bit light and I've found it works better.  We touched right after the start of the 1000 foot markers (my point) and he said that's good enough for me, let's go back to the ramp!

All in all, the ride wasn't as hard as I had feared.  I probably had spent 10 hours practicing maneuvers with my instructor and 4-5 on my own.  Mostly power off 180s, in the end.  I'm glad that I really brushed up on these things, because it had been quite a long time since I really focused on any of them.

This CFI got upset when I did that, and told me to ""cut"" the angle to bring the nose down. His way is to avoid the ""zero G"" effect of nosing down abruptly.

His way definitely reduced the zero G effect, but also felt really strange in my stomach to be slow, banking further and nosing down before going wings level.

He's the CFI and has a million more hours than me, so I'm sure he's right. Is there any reason I was taught the other way by the CFIs I had in the past?

470,Fry Scholarship/GI Bill benefits,"Full disclosure, quarter life crisis is in full-swing.

I've been days lurking, reading, and combing r/flying trying to find the answers to my questions. Most of which have been asked and answered thoroughly. I'm just trying to get some clarity on a very odd situation. 

Context: almost 27, BA (Psychology) and MA (Education Admin). Currently teaching Science in Vietnam in order to pay off undergrad student debt, no debt from grad school. Planning to move back to the US in June.

I've always dreamed of flying, but never thought it was something I could afford to do. I'm completely burnt out in education (primary all the way to university). I'm looking for a career change before it's too late. I've been reading more posts and watching more YouTube videos than I would like to admit. I've spent the last 2 years figuring out what to do with my life after a family tragedy (read below), and I think this is a dream I want to chase. I have Christmas holiday coming up at school, planning to travel somewhere so I can do a discovery flight over the holiday. 

Here's my specific question.. I have GI Bill education benefits through the Fry Scholarship. It's a scholarship given to survivors of soldiers killed in the line of duty (my dad was in 2017, while working with the DPAA). I've spent a lot of time reflecting and I think flying is something I want to pursue, and use these benefits for, and give myself a new start in something I've always wanted to do. This is the best use of this money I can think of, and know it's what my dad would want. 

The Fry scholarship is essentially Post 9/11, chapter 33 funds, but it's limited to academic programs (I can't use the benefits for a flight school like some service members can). So I'm on the hunt for universities that offer some sort of fast track program, summer courses, to get me through in about 2-3 years? As much included in the coursework as possible to set me up well to make my way to regionals. 

Thank you for spending your valuable time to help an indecisive millennial make up his mind..

TL:DR
Using GI Bill/Fry Scolarship funding. Searching for fast track university programs that will get me as many qualifications as possible in one place, ready to move to regionals.

I'm trying to find some clarification on solo with a temporary student certificate.

This Advisory Circular I found seems to indicate that you need to have the permanent cert in your hand to solo: https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_61-65F.pdf
Page 8 11a
&gt; NOTE: A Temporary Airman Certificate will not be issued for use while
&gt; waiting for the permanent certificate to be received. The permanent
&gt; certificate must be in the pilot’s possession to exercise solo privileges. 

This seems confusing though since in IACRA a Temporary Airman Certificate HAS been issued. Also what is the point of the temporary if you can't use it?

One of the instructors at my school claims that he spoke to someone at the FAA who said you do actually need to wait for the permanent plastic certificate in order to solo, however I'm not sure how valid this is, so I'm looking for some proof to prove otherwise if available.

485,Shaken after reading about an accident close to home.,"It is true what they say that when you're in aviation, at some point in your career, you will know someone that will be involved in an accident. Me being a student that just got his PPL has yet to meet this certain someone. ""Maybe it's just in the US where general aviation is widespread"", I thought. Until this day...

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier I was browsing through the web and stumbled upon a report about a local crash. A King Air performing medivac flight collided with the terrain. Unfortunately, no one survived.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first heard about it two months ago, I didn't really care. I thought that maybe I'll just read about it more when the investigation results come out. It was merely another statistical outlier in our generally safe industry. I thought ""meh, it won't happen to me, I'm studying, I'm doing my part"" and shrugged it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, when I saw it again, I dived into further reading regarding the accident, I was surprised. Of the two pilots on board, one of them was a graduate in my flight school. It struck my curiosity. A three-minute read became hours of looking into news articles and reports about the accident. It was devastating. I'm not personally friends with him but I can feel emotions that I don't get when reading about other crashes, locally and internationally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then looked to our local pilot's forum. I read about speculations on the cause of the accident. It was an in-flight breakup. They flew into a thunderstorm and allegedly broke out of the clouds without both of their outboard wings starting from near the engine nacelles. I thought it was impossible and unfair. Of all the possible events that we can encounter, it's probably one of the worst. I mean how can we be prepared? We can't simulate losing our wings in flight! If there are, surely it's not a part of the basic training. I then dived a little bit more and there it was. I saw a video of the crash. The plane was in a dive obviously struggling for control and then it pitched up hard until it stalled. It entered a steep bank to the left before it suddenly went on the cover of the trees and a large bang followed by a huge plume of smoke came out. I couldn't confirm at first that a part of the wings are not really there, partly because I'm not really familiar with how a King Air looks like in flight. I continued scrolling until I saw an image.  It was a picture of the aircraft in flight, clearly with part of their wings missing. It was chilling. I couldn't even imagine what the crew was thinking about on that specific moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The forum then proceeded with a discussion of how they probably exceeded maneuvering speed in the soup etc etc but what I clearly thought was we're not invulnerable. I was reminded that no matter what the statistics say, every time we go out and fly, we have one of our feet in the grave. A flight is always doomed to fail unless the crew make the correct decisions from the beginning to the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is better to assume that an engine will fail enroute until  you reach your destination. 

It is better to assume that an approach is missed until the rollout.

It is better to assume that the cb infront of you can disorient you and tear your plane apart.

&amp;#x200B;

It's so easy to feel invulnerable up there because of the accident statistics and people saying that aviation has never been safer but what I learned today is that, when we're up in the air, statistics don't matter. Only you, your plane, and your decisions decide what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- New kid gets his first dose of aviation reality.

 I have caulked all around the firewall and have poured water all over the firewall, and taken a hose to the plane but with no luck in trying to get it to leak.

1,Converting a FAA rating to a Canadian one," Guys I need your help.  


I've read this document over and over again prior to submitting my application in person. I've even had some professionals (TC inspector who issued my PPL + the receptionist at TCs office) read &amp; interpret the requirements. The FTU I'm currently enrolled in are trying to convince me that I have to meet the requirements as stated in Division 7, 421.42 in the CARs in order to CONVERT a FAA NIGHT RATING. I converted my FAA PPL earlier in the year in accordance with the IPL agreement. The process was awfully slow due to incompetency on their end but it was issued in the end. I'm yet to submit my application to convert my FAA Instrument Rating as I have to conduct a FAA IPC first (FAAIA exam done already). However a little over a month ago I submitted an application to have my night rating endorsed in accordance with the IPL since I have met the conditions as stated in the advisory circular.  


I'm pretty sure I can read but can someone please confirm that the Advisory Circular (No 401-001, Chapter 6.6) clearly states that one must have 10 hours night experience (Solo,Dual, or PIC) along with 10 hours instrument time(I have both)?  


Again can someone please help me understand why instructors at my FTU are trying to say that I have insufficient time to have a night rating endorsed &amp; that my application will probably be declined. They keep referring to the CARs (421.42) hour experience breakdown (10 hours night including, 5 hours dual (2hr XC) + 5 hours solo including 10 take offs/landings) My total night hour break down might be similar but not exactly the same as stated in 421.42 however those this even apply to me?  


They make it sound as if TC purposely never went into detail about the hour breakdown in the advisory circular for conditions on converting a FAA night rating or they made a typo or they're just plain wrong and trying to swindle me. Yelp

12,Wallet stolen at a small airport which messed up quite a bit my plans,"Basically decided to fly my humble C172 from Florida to VT and back.

On the way back stopped at a small airport in coal country. Very nice location and amazing landing.

I took habit of calling the FBO(s) of the airport I would land at next to make sure a courtesy car would be available or enquire if the FBO is accessible after hours.

This time the courtesy car was important as both ways the trip takes roughly 2 days so I would need to spend the night where I would land.

The guy at the other end told me they closed at 1700 local BUT given I would need to spend the night he would do me  a favor... leave the keys of the vehicle in a drop box. All he needed is my tail # and my drivers license #.

So I pulled my wallet out to give him the info. Just as I finished... the Unicomm radio in the lobby blasted at full volume. Someone set it to maximum for some obscure reason. But it was enough for me to have a knee jerk reaction of standing up as I was busy talking to the guy on my cell and I laid out my wallet on a table by the TV in the lounge. Instead of back in my pant's pocket.

For some reason it had to be at the end of the room. Cheese hole #1 and #2 (loud radio that distracted me and my reaction).

It was my last call before I packed up and set to board my plane and fly away. As I was pulling out a group of young people seemed out of place. More like white trash/rednecks with one dude a tattooed clown only in pants in suspenders going straight for the FBO.

I took off, and about 1/2 hr into a flight had the biggest ""oh shit"" moment reaching into my pocket where some other stuff was in a pocket below making it look like I had my wallet. The flashback of the conversation and me standing up and laying the wallet came in a flash. Cheese hole #3

I turned around (which I actually captured in liveATC's archives). But when I came back nothing. I second guessed myself as it may maybe have fallen inside the plane from my pant's pockets... but finally I flagged someone who was connected to the airport, and soon a few helpful fellas dug up the footage of the hidden cameras around the lobby to reveal one bitch with pigtails and a dark coat and hat walking to my wallet exactly 1/2 after I left. The whole chain of events is on video including the 2 couples that were in that group and how the thieving biatch made sure to look left and right and backed off carefully after taking what I needed to fucking travel and pay for gas.

Everyone at the airport banded to help me and offered food in the next 2 effing days I had to wait for a replacement credit card.

And they all told me this never happens and people that don't belong to the airport never show up. But for some reason by a fucking freak of probabilities they showed up at the perfect moment to make a crime.

Cheese hole #4. Now when I look at at least those few holes that perfectly aligned that day I think either I was the unluckiest pilot ever or that things are about to get ugly as more and more of the trash populace is left behind by a society that evolves and they don't.

And crime it is. Felony theft and possibly federal crime as the footage also shows them heading towards a twin and possibly trying to break into it.

I am an atheist so I don't believe in the sanctity of life of whatever BS that is. Nature and dichotomic natural selection ie Darwin assign a survivability and value factor to any live system and I believe the average pilot is worth a million trash dirtbags.

Ironically twice in my life black men chased me to either give me a wallet I left in a nightclub's bathroom or a debit card I left in an ATM. Here I had the experience of what fucking white useless and to be exterminated white thrash is.

I had certainly dark thoughts now. I made it home after getting my replacement cards, but in the context of 7 billion people on the planet, to keep those that are criminals is no benefit, to destroy them is no loss.

I hope that fucking bitch brought enough fentanyl to kill herself and enough of her group, because I do believe they are probably fucking opiates addicts and as such completely useless to society.

Pilots are different, we see the constraints of physics, nature, we see how drugs are lethal for us in more than one way. For me pilots and a few other professions concentrate the best of mankind, besides flight being the best achievement of mankind.

To keep the rest is of no benefit, to destroy them is no loss in the context of mass overpopulation and robotics. Things will have to change in the penal system for the rapid eradication of those who are a disease to humanity.",flying,1570068352,totalialogika,53,0,True,2019-10-02
13,Pennsylvania flight schools,"Hi, I'm a highschool student (11th grade) and want to start flight training pretty soon. I live in south-central Pennsylvania (around Chambersburg). It's a pretty small area, and I don't know anyone else that got into aviation in PA. My end goal is a airline career. I've been looking around and only found a few options that I like so far.

One school I am looking at is [High Flight Academy](https://www.highflightacademy.com/) in Pittsburgh. It seems like a descent school, and it's got just about everything I've been looking for: well reviewed, decent fleet of aircraft including a simulator, and I could get everything at once there (multi, IR, etc.). The only problem is that Pittsburgh is about 3 hours away, which won't work since I need to go to school at the same time.

The first of the two I found in Maryland is [Hagerstown Flight School](https://hagerstownflightschool.org/). Hagerstown is only 45 minutes away, the closest that I've found. They've got two Cessna 172s and a simulator. Other than that, I can't find much without calling. Reviews are almost non-existent, so I don't really know much about them.

The other Maryland school is [Bravo Flight Training](https://www.bravoflighttraining.com/) in Fredrick, Maryland, about an hour and a half away. It seems like they have pretty good instructors, a descent fleet of Cessna 172s, a Cessna 140, Cessna 150s, a Piper Arrow, an RV12 kit plane, and a simulator. The biggest downside is that I couldn't get a multi-engine here. So far, this seems like my best option; its not terrible far, but it has a lot going for it.

I'm still open to other suggestions, because I admit I'm not the greatest at researching this stuff. The problem seems that we live hours away from any major city, and aviation is non-existent around here.

tl;dr: I live in south-central PA, can't find flight school I'm fully satisfied with, need suggestions/advice",flying,1570072469,Wolfdog987,21,4,True,2019-10-02

I’m not new to aviation as a whole, but new to the civilian training side of things and as a result, I don’t know what I don’t know, so asking this community seemed like a great idea. 

Current situation: 
I am a 29 year old Blackhawk crew chief working in the U.A.E. on contract, but moving back to the US by the end of the month. I have 50% of my Post 9/11 GI Bill remaining which is good for about $14,000/year at a standalone part 141 vocational school such as SkyWarrior - which won’t take long to burn through, especially dedicating all of my time to training. I understand a part 141 university pays out more overall than a vocational, but it also takes much longer. I am fortunate enough to be able to fund the rest out of pocket in order to get things done faster, but I want to make sure that extra expense is efficiently spent/invested. 

Aviation Experience: 
-0 hours logged and no formal training (just flying around with buddies over the years)
-3 years US Army Blackhawk maintainer, 2 of which were with flight experience
-2 years skydiving instruction with 2200+ jumps 
-1 year contracted (current job) on Blackhawks as a crew chief in the U.A.E. Totally probably 800 hours on H-60’s

44,How To Screw Up an Intentional Wheels-Up Landing,"How To Screw Up an Intentional Wheels-Up Landing

 I  entered Weiser Airpark’s traffic pattern in northwest Houston at 1,000  feet, reduced power on the single-engine 1968 Piper Arrow and put the  landing gear handle down. The increased sound of wind and the obvious  drag told me the gear was in transit. When I felt it lock in place, I  glanced at the three lights on the panel to ensure everything was good.  It wasn’t. I had two green and one yellow. The right gear had not locked  in place.

No other planes were in  the pattern, so I extended downwind and placed the gear handle back in  the up position. After all three gear lights extinguished, I put the  gear handle back down. Recycle the gear—standard procedure. But the  right gear light still glowed yellow. I continued west over the rice  fields, and called Weiser unicom to try to get Newt, our mechanic, on  the radio. He returned my call on a hand-held radio from his maintenance  hangar.

“Newt, I’m west of the  field. I’ve got a yellow light on the right main gear. I recycled the  gear twice and I still have a yellow light.”

“It could be a bad sensor,” he told me. “Or maybe it needs a little force to make it lock down. Is the gear down now?”

“Yes.”

“Try yawing the plane around. Get some side action on it.”

I shoved my right foot down, then the left foot, then repeated the action while I watched for the light to turn green.

“It’s not working, Newt. Still got a yellow light.”

“Okay.  Okay. Tell you what. Put the gear up, get some altitude then descend.  When you’re at the bottom of the descent, put the gear down and when you  think it’s about to lock down, pull back on the wheel to give the plane  a jerk up.”

I did as instructed. Twice.

“Well shit,” Newt said. “Maybe it’s the sensor. Fly over the field and do a low pass. I’ll be out there and have a look.”

I  came straight in from the west, passing over the runway at fifty feet  as Newt and his helper stood to the side of the runway. I climbed back  up and Newt called from his hand-held.

“Paul, the right wheel is cocked to the side just a little. You’ve got a problem.”

I  knew my boss Ray was in his office listening to everything. He always  monitored the frequency. The Arrow was one of his lease-back planes, but  he never came on the radio.

“Why  don’t you try doing another pass, only this time try to nudge the wheel  on the ground. It might straighten out the wheel and you can come around  and land.”

My first pass was so  gentle I never touched the ground. The second time, my wheels kissed the  dirt and grass runway, and I climbed back up.

“That was nice,” Newt said. “Let’s see how it looks now.”

I flew another low pass over the runway.

“Uh, Paul,” Newt said over the radio. “Your right wheel is now perpendicular to where it should be.”

Shit.

“You  can’t land with the gear like that,” Newt said as I climbed to the  downwind leg and leveled off. “You’ll put a side-load on the gear when  you touch down and maybe break it.

Fuck.

“Are you saying I’ve got to do a wheels-up landing?”

An intentional wheels-up landing? I don’t remember that in any of the flight manuals.

“I’m afraid so,” said Newt.

Ray  still hadn’t chimed in. I was going to have to belly-land one of his  lease-backs, yet he was apparently leaving everything up to me.

“Could be worse,” Newt said. “At least you’re on grass. Won’t be any sparks.”

Great. Now I’ve got to think about a fire or worse—an explosion.

I  raised the gear and continued downwind in the usual manner. On final  approach, I cut all the electrics with the master switch, and when I  knew I had the runway made, I cut the mixture. The engine stopped, but  the propeller kept windmilling. I had set up nicely.

At  about 300 feet, I heard something. Shit. The gear was coming down on  its own. The Piper Arrow had an automatic gear extension for when pilots  forgot to put the gear down. I had figured that mechanism was disabled  with no electricity. Wrong. I reached  behind the flap handle and used  my forefinger to pull up on the small, automatic gear-extension override  lever. The plastic handle had long disappeared, and my finger dented  deeply as I held the gear up. I knew that finger was not going to make  it out of this unscathed. But if that was my only casualty, I’d be  happy.

The Arrow touched down on  the center of the grass runway, and I had to push hard with my left foot  on the rudder pedal to keep the plane from going off the right side of  the runway. I had unlatched the door on final, so when the plane came to  a quick stop, I unclicked my seat belt, shoved the door open, and  jumped off the wing. My drop from the wing was less distance than I had  anticipated, and I stumbled on the ground before catching my balance.  Cecil, the airport owner, and his tractor were there waiting. Newt and  his assistant walked toward me.

I  glanced under the wing. The gear was down, and the right tire was still  perpendicular. My attempt to override the auto gear extension had  failed. Behind the plane, the tire had dug a 200-ft trench on the  runway. Cecil got off his tractor, laughing.

“You shoulda seen ol’ Paul,” he told Newt. “He almost broke a leg scramblin’ down from that plane.

He was right. I had anticipated jumping down only about a foot instead of almost four feet.

We  inspected the gear. A bolt connecting the two arms had come loose,  allowing the lower portion to pivot. Newt retrieved another bolt from  his hangar, and three of us lifted the wing while he straightened the  gear and inserted the bolt. I taxied the plane back to the hangar.

For  a long time, local pilots did not let me forget that I had the  distinction of being the only pilot who could fuck up a wheels-up  landing.

Ray never said a thing.

47,Military Pilot Trying to Get PPL,"Quick question for you guys.  I am an Army Helicopter pilot recently graduated from flight school.  Before I left I made sure to get my FAA commercial and instrument rating for rotor craft with the S-70 rating.  Our IP's at Fort Rucker told us to pay the $200 to get the license, but in reality we weren't really sure what we were doing.

I remember taking a basic airman knowledge test that I passed prior to getting my FAA license.  

I've also been reading this website below to try and get a grip on what I will need to get my fixed wing PPL.

Basically I have read that I don't need to get a student license or FAA medical exam.  Also I only need to get 20 instructional hours &amp; 10 solo hours in a fixed wing.  I have read online that part of getting your PPL is taking some sort of written test in addition to a check ride,  do I need to retake a written test? Or does the license I already have count for that?

I was scheduled to attempt my first solo last Sunday, but scheduling issues got in the way of that so I was moved to Tuesday morning. I didn’t end up doing it on Tuesday because of a 15 kt crosswind. Finally, Thursday morning comes around. The weather is perfect and I feel great. The plan was to go up and fly a few patterns with my instructor, and then he’d get out and I’d fly a single pattern by myself. I went up with the instructor and nailed four out of five landings. A steady 10 kt crosswind developed during the session, so that complicated things just a little bit. The point was to make sure that I could do it safely by myself. We both agreed that I was ready so we taxied back to the FBO. Instructor told me to request a single pattern and then a full stop. He also told me to do a run up just like normal to be extra safe. I got to follow a P-40 to the runway which was pretty neat, and started my run up. Set the parking break, flight controls good, engine to 2000, gauges in the green, key to right magneto and I lose 500 RPM. I requested taxi back to parking, and went home. Let’s hope for Saturday.

Who would know if the pilot were to turn off the transponder when leaving the air space and fly out of it into an area which the ADS-B was not required.

I ask as I've read some pilots say they are not going to be flying within the req'd airspace so they don't concern themselves with the requirements. However, if you were to purchase a plane that was in a hanger/airport that resides within the req'd airspace then you/they could not fly the plane out of the airport to an area to either be added back at your home airport or to an airspace that does not require the system to be installed.

55,0 to Flight instructor in 18 months in Canada,"TL;DR
PPL, ME, IR, CPL, FI in 18 months.
Approx cost. 70,000 CAD.
It was pretty hard.

I just passed my instructor rating ride few days ago and wanted to share my experience going through the training in Canada.

Also, people in the US how the heck do you guys go from 0 to CFI in less than a year? I don't think it's possible at all up here. Please somebody prove me wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ground School**
I exclusively used Harv's Air (pilottraining.ca). I watched all PPL course videos. After that it wasn't too painful to carry on with IFR/MULTI/CPL/Instructor since each course shares most of the videos with each other. I started my PPL grounds school few weeks before starting my actual training and ended up writing PPL written within 5 days of my PPL ride.

**PPL**
So I had my full-time job and was working full time hours during in the beginning of my training. I tried to start my PPL in March after I did my intro flight in January, thinking the sucky Canadian weather should be good by then. Boy I was wrong. I tried to fly 2 to 3 times a week but all my lessons got canceled until late March. In May, my lessons got picked up by good weather. I soloed in May and passed my PPL ride in August. So PPL roughly took 5 months.

**Post PPL time building &amp; Night rating &amp; Instrument training**
I took a month off after my PPL for vacation and started my night rating in late September. Got my night rating within a month. Then started building XC time mainly at night because I needed 50hrs PIC XC for my IFR later. At the same time I began training for IFR. I was in the sim practicing IFR stuff in a multi engine aircraft.

By February/March I completed 50hr PIC time and decided to do actual IFR training in a single engine trainer and finished my IFR XC and about 30/40 IFR hours needed. All in all this took about 5 months.

**Multi Engine Rating**
I planned to do my multi rating within a month and do my instrument ride pretty much right after. In Canada, you need to do your instrument ride in multi engine to fly multi instrument.

In March, I attempted to start my multi rating but it didn't go as planned. Multi instructor wasn't available often and 1 of 2 multi plane was down for a long time for maintenance when I started my multi rating. After I switched an instructor due to his limited availability, I finished my multi rating with 10hrs multi time logged including flight test. I passed mine in mid May so it took about 2 month.

**Multi + Instrument (Group 1)**
As soon as I finished my multi rating, 1 of 2 multi trainer came back from the maintenance haha. I started doing some instrument training in the multi. By the time I did my instrument ride I had little over 40hr IFR. I passed my instrument (Group 1) in Mid June. So it took a month from my multi rating to multi instrument ride.

**CPL**
After I passed my instrument ride I decided to resign from my full time position and to work part time. It was June and the weather in Canada was getting better and better. I wanted to finish everything while the weather was still good. I hopped back in the Cessna and started working on my rusty air exercises like spins for CPL standards. I wrote my exam on the first day of August. So from Group 1 ride to CPL only took about 1.5 month.

**Instructor rating**
After my CPL I had to wait just a bit for a Class 1 Instructor to start my instructor rating. When I started my instructor rating it was Monday to Friday training. I decided not to work and only work during the weekends. I banged out ground portion (teaching PGIs...) really quick and started flying portion as well. The day of my flight instructor ride. I had to wake up at 4:30, come to airport at 0600 so I and my class 1 instructor can finish the remaining 3hrs of my 30hr flying experience required for the test. I wrote the test the same day afternoon and I passed! Instructor rating only took 1.5 month (7 weeks to be accurate). Kudos to my Class 1 to make this happen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was really challenging since I had my career job and had to commute to the airport 1hr to 1.5hr with traffic one way. Full-on training definitely took a toll on my other aspects of life. Some days I would work in the morning and fly in the evening or fly in the morning and work in the evening. It was a grind after a grind but I'm proud I did it.

*Delays*
Weather really sucks ass in Canada. Weather delay should account for at least 3 month in the 18 months I took to finish this.

Although I trained at a big ass school, I didn't have too hard time securing airplanes. I would always check the flight schedule pro at work and if there was any cancellation I'd snatch that booking. My main instructor also worked long hours and weekends. 

*Cost*
I really don't want to think about it and I will know how much it cost to rent the plane at the end of the year. I am assuming I easily spent 70,000 CAD. 13% Sales tax for every flying hour is kind of a bitch here. I'm not counting gas money I had to spend to drive to the airport. Miscellaneous items might or not be included.

*Hours*
I just did my logbook and I got 253hrs. Some of the hours was just for fun outside my training. In Canada the minimum you need for just CPL is 200hrs by the way.


If you guys have any question let me know I will try to answer! Hopefully my post can help you plan your training.",flying,1570157000,MeanCanadien,41,42,True,2019-10-03
57,It has been one hell of a week!,"On Tuesday I did a whirlwind trip with a friend. SBP-FAT-BFL-SNA-CMA-SBP. I got a puncture in the nose tire on the rollout after landing in BFL. That was fun. Luckily I planned enough extra time at each stop we still completed the trip in 12 hours. Shout out to Golden State Aircraft Maintenance at KBFL. They were fast and awesome!

On Wednesday I flew to MYF for meetings. At 1630, I walked up to the plane to head back home, I noticed a leak. Fuel was leaking out of the bottom of the cowling through a small tube. Apparently the Hartzell (mechanical) fuel pumps are POS and have a leaky diaphragm. There is an alert service bulletin from Hartzell about it. The three A&amp;Ps I talked to knew about it. They all said I would be able to make the 2-hour flight home, but I wasn't comfortable with that. I decided to stay the night. The plane is one month out of warranty.

59,I’m working on CFI and I’m trying to get my lift explanation right. Can anyone help me sort this out?,"Over the years I’ve heard many people explain different ways on how lift is generated. Most of them say that the previous explanation by the last person was wrong. For example while working on my private I was told that air speeds up over the top of the wing because the air above and below the wing must meet. I know this is wrong but I’m also hearing different theories.

Some people say that lift is generated by the coanda effect meaning that as the stream of air flows over and under the wing is it deflected downwards and that equal and opposite reaction of the air being deflected down results in the wing being deflected upwards, therefore lifting the wing.

What I’m going on now is that as the air flows over the wing the curvature of the wing causes the air to rush down the curve to “fill in the gaps where air isn’t” because if it didn’t then a vacuum would form (I think this is called flow turning, someone correct me if I’m wrong). And as the air rushes down the wing bernoulis principle states that as the speed of a fluid increases the pressure decreases. So the flatter underside of the wing doesn’t have have air rushing around a curvature and therefore is not accelerated, so it has higher pressure then above the wing. High pressure seeks low and boom lift. And also because the air being deflected down, deflects the wing up (newtons 3rd law).

So what is the correct way to explain lift and why does the air stick to the wing?

64,Scariest low and slow moments?,"Just want to hear some stuff to learn from, and to get any feedback from you guys as I'm always trying to learn from multiple perspectives.

In my meager 20 hours, I have two moments that stand out. Both of them involve wind shear in a LSA on windy days.

On one, my speeds were great one second, and the next second I hear the stall horn, 50kias, instinctively push forward and actually feel the stall buffet before recovering. CFI says it was due to a change in wind over our terrain but would have stalled if we increased AoA at all.

Recently, near the same area of terrain, I'm on short final. I thought my glide slope was getting shallow.  ""power?"" Instructor said no.  I tend to come in high because I get nervous on short field landings near terrain, so I figured that was the case again. A few seconds later it was apparent we just sunk . I eased throttle in, felt instructors hand reach for throttle, saw we sunk to what FELT like near eye level with the bushes about to land short, and just crammed full throttle and carb heat as quick as I could, stall horn blaring and saw 45kias. Never pushed forward just kept her level then climbed. This CFI said we could have just blipped some power and landed, but I personally was surprised we didn't have bushes stuck in the landing gear, so I think go around was the right choice.

78,Electrical failure in flight - Writeup,"Hello all! I have a fun story to tell.

I am a ~25 hour PPL student. I completed my first solo about 5 hours prior in a Cessna 172 through a local flight club. The C172 is currently down for maintenance, so my instructor and I decided to fly one of the club's Cherokee 140s.

I've been up in a Cherokee once before, but it was only for an hour and I never landed the plane.

We took off at sunset without incident and began to climb towards the practice area. About 10 minutes into the flight, my instructor asked me to put my foggles on to practice some hood training.

I successfully followed his navigation directions for about 10 minutes when my headset began to make a sevree buzzing noise. My instructor and I were struggling to hear each other. I unplugged my headset and noticed buzzing sounds coming from the cabin intercom as well.

I took my foggles off and focused on flying the airplane as my instructor began troubleshooting the issue. He flipped the avionics switch off and on... except they never came back on. We lost all electrical in flight - including radios.

My first inclination was to squad 7600 on the transponder but when I glanced down at it, it was off.

He fiddled with the switch a bit more and checked all the breakers as I continued to fly the plane. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

He instructed me to fly back to the airport as he called the tower on his Bluetooth headset. He let them know we lost electrical and communications. They gave us clearance to land.

As we were on final for the runway, I could see the light gun shooting out from the tower. A nice solid green. 

We landed very smoothly (especially for my first landing a Cherokee) and parked it at the FBO. We didn't have landing or taxi lights, but thankfully it hadn't gotten too dark out yet.

The plane is going in the shop next week. I'm very curious to know what happened.

This experience was very eye-opening for me. I always read stories about mechanical or electrical issues people experience in flight. I never thought it would happen to me. It just goes to show how anything can happen to anyone at any time.",flying,1570213308,CarbonDudeoxide,19,41,True,2019-10-04

1. Risk level for having concentrates on me through security in UK? Particularly concerned about any dogs in the UK since cannabis is illegal. 

2. If too risky, should I consider: checking a duffel w concentrates in Seattle, reclaim in UK, and check bag again in UK and go through security without it in me. 

3. should I consider canceling my accommodations during layover and avoid going through UK security all together.

86,I got my Instrument rating before u/Schteevie !!,"So, strap in - this is gonna be a long one (that's what she said).

I started my instrument training at a 141 program at KFRG in May of 2018. I took a bit of a leisurely pace because the commute from Harlem all the way out to Long Island via public transit is long, and people generally suck in NYC.

Everything was going fine, and I was about to do my long XC flight, until work sent me out on the road permanently in December of 2018. I work on a fairly prominent Broadway show, and was transferred to the touring company. As you may know - once you start with a 141 program - you can't finish it anywhere else. So I was pretty well screwed.

I did fly here and there at different flight schools around the country to keep my skills sharp, and eventually took a week vacation to try and finish it all up in May of this year. I ended up getting all the required instrument hours, long XC, got a 97% on my written (thank you Sheppard air), and got all the stage checks finished, but then I ran into another problem. As a Canadian with a ""foreign based"" FAA PPL, I had my first, last, and middle name on my FAA Pilot certificate which I received in 2015. At some point I renewed my Passport and thought ""why not just leave off my middle name this time - who cares?"". Big. Mistake.

Now the name on my Pilot Cert did not match the name on ANY of my photo IDs... I big stoopid man. So, that meant I had to get a name correction on my Pilot Cert, which meant that I had to get another letter of verification from Transport Canada and the FAA before I could go to the FSDO and get it fixed. So, heartbroken me went back off on the road and waited for the magical letter to appear. Eventually it came, and the nice folks at the Van Nuys FSDO hooked me up! I kept flying at random places around the country until this magical week off from work came, and little old me flew back to NYC for 4 days with all my requirements done, and a brand new PPL with the right name.

Now to the test!

I was scheduled for the checkride on Thursday, Oct 3, flew twice Tuesday and Wednesday to make sure I was ready, and to get reacquainted with the insanely busy airspace around NYC. Yesterday (Thursday) happened to be the only terrible weather day of the week (ovc 007 BR) so we just did the oral. I had studied those IFR Pilot's Cafe sheets, and read the ASA Instrument oral guide, and went back over the Cessna King course- and it turns out I was grossly over prepared. The oral lasted about 45 mins. The DPE asked a few of the typical questions - currency req's, when can you go below minimums, where and what kind of Wx info would you get and what is a convective sigmet etc, but then mostly scenario based questions like ""You're flying and you see ice pellets hitting your plane- what's happening and how do you get out"" and ""you lose comms 600' AGL after takeoff and your clearance was 2000' expect 7000' after ten mins direct BDR and hold, EFC at 10:00 for a filed plan to KPVD. What route and altitude?"". DPE seemed pleased and gave me a discontinuance for weather. This kinda sucked because I had a flight booked from JFK to DEN the next morning, but I sucked it up and changed the flight to 7:45 PM Friday.

We reconvened today for the flight portion and it wasn't looking awesome weather wise. 2000' ceiling and winds 330@12 G33...

DPE asked me whether I wanted to go ahead or not, but warned me I would not be given any leeway if I busted minimums or got a full scale deflection on anything despite the gust factor. I was feeling confident and decided to go ahead with the ride. 

We went for a SE departure to the practice area and did one descending Vne unusual attitude, a few compass turns, then started getting vectors for the ILS 6 into KISP. It was a ROLLERCOASTER trying to keep on that glide slope, but I managed, despite having a descent rate of 1200fpm at times - but the DPE seemed to let that slide as there was absolutely no other way of avoiding full scale deflection. Got different missed instructions from ATC and then started getting set up for the LOC 6 into KISP, that one was fine, and the started off the missed towards DPK VOR and was asked how I would enter the hold. Once I responded correctly, the DPE broke me off that course and started acting as ATC and giving me vectors for the GPS 1 into KFRG, since the grumpy controller on 120.05 got on and immediately made everyone doing practice approaches punch out and go VFR because he is miserable and takes it out on everyone else haha (trust me everyone recognizes this guy's voice and knows they won't get any more approaches). I managed to not screw this one up, got the plane on the ground in one piece and taxied into the ramp. 

Aaaand that was it. It was the most difficult ""IFR"" flight I have ever done. Those winds were throwing me around at all times, not just during the approaches. Holding altitude and heading was extremely challenging, and as a 6'4'' dude, I definitely hit my head on the ceiling a few times due to the turbulence. But I passed! The DPE had a few notes on what I could improve on - changing the CDI from GPS to the Localizer a little earlier than 2 miles before the FAF, got a little slow on the approach (\~75KIAS) once and to keep the nose wheel straight before starting the run up, but I passed. Almost a year and a half working towards this and I'm done. I'm more relieved that I didn't make a stupid mistake than anything else. Now I can't wait to go file on my own.

105,Question about ultralight and near ultralight aircraft,"Hey!  Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I’ve got a few questions that I’d like some help answering.  I won’t be able to do much with the information anytime soon though as grad school and the birth of my son have financially grounded me, so this is curiosity and long term research.  I’ve been researching ultralight kits on account of cost and space requirements and have run into some confusion.  I understand that the requirements for part 103 are really restrictive.  The airplane can’t cruise faster than 50kts, weigh more than 254lbs, or carry more than one person.  Since I really want one day to own an airplane I was looking at them regardless.  I noticed two designs that stuck out to me:  The Fisher Koala and Super Koala.  Since I’m really interested in owning a plane that I could carry my son in one day, the Koala is out.  But the Super Koala doesn’t conform to part 103.  It carries two people, cruises faster than 50kts, and weighs up to 400lbs depending on configuration.  So here are my questions:

1) Would this plane be registered as a light sport aircraft?

2) If so, what would the required equipment be?  Would I need to have a radio, transponder, ADSB, etc.?

3) As a PPL, I can fly under Sport Pilot privileges in an LSA but would it be possible or advantageous to get it certified such that I could fly using my PPL privileges, i.e. not as an E-LSA aircraft.

4) One advantage of ultralight/near ultralight aircraft would be the ability to hangar it at home.  A relatively modest 5 acres would have enough space for the runway I would need.  My wife and I want at least that much land anyway once I get done with grad school and we get settled.  If I have an E-LSA aircraft at home would there be any regulatory headaches that I would not have with a part 103 aircraft?

I drove to Florida. Stopped by w29 (Stevensville, MD) and visited with the folks at Chesapeake Sport Pilot. My interest was finding a possible training airport and to get up close to an LSA. I looked at one at Reno Stead a few years ago, but never really thought I might be forced to fly one.  I was able to look at the RV-12 and the Tecnam Eaglet.  Well, they are indeed aircraft type vehicles...shrug. 

X-Winds were guesting around 30 mph. Rose Bult offered to take me up for a short intro, but I opted to check-in again on my way back north. I'd be most interested in trying some maneuvers in an LSA and decided to wait for some smoother air. I am a 100 hr, life-long student pilot...looking to finally earn a rating. LSA is not my first choice. (no need to clutter this thread with the finer details describing the ball and chain of light sport aircraft certification and the associated pilot rating. Trust me. I get it. And for those holding out hope that Basic Med equipment limitations will one day sync-up with LSA Pilot Cert, it will never happen.  LSA will always be just that. It will never include NORMAL or UTILITY category aircraft unfortunately)

Well, let me know if you own one of these flying machines and might want to go for a hop. I'd be happy to meet-up and introduce myself. If for whatever reason you decided you don't want to go flying with internet stranger...I totally understand.

Also, in case I end up taking the discovery flight, can anyone recommend an operation? Thanks",flying,1570308441,LostTime20,1,0,True,2019-10-05

123,Showed my hand to the FAA and it paid off,"So I started flying about a year and a half ago. Did my medical about 2 years ago. While filling out the medical application I failed to correctly identify that I had been convicted of a DUI. The reason behind it was because 1 - I didn't realize it was considered a conviction and 2 - I legitimately thought they only wanted DUI's that were reflected on my driving record. But I started to think about it and I realized that I should have answered yes. The reason I didn't think that it was considered a conviction was because it happened while I was stationed in Japan as active duty Air Force. I received a non-judicial punishment (article 15) because of it. It never went on any type of driving record and it's very likely that the FAA would have never found out about it. I'm not able to ever fly ATP or other commercial carriers due to other medical factors and I only every planned on getting my to my CFI and stopping.

So I called AOPA and talked someone about getting pilot protection because I wanted to talk this over with a lawyer before I did anything. It just so happened that my membership was only a couple weeks from being and they pro-rate the cost based on your membership dues. So it cost me $4.00 to talk with a lawyer. They also gave me a voucher for a free 30 minute session with a local aviation lawyer which I ended up not using. I then wrote a letter to the FAA (I can no longer find a copy for some reason) and told them pretty much exactly what I said above. I was misunderstood, and I never intended to intentionally mislead or disguise. I waited and worried for 6 months before they replied and the first two pages of the letter(\[here)\[ [https://imgur.com/a/wwuyqFa?](https://imgur.com/a/wwuyqFa?) \] was it. So I did exactly what the letter said and sent it back immediately. Then of course waited again until they replied with the last page (here)\[ [https://imgur.com/a/wwuyqFa?](https://imgur.com/a/wwuyqFa?) \]

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I'm a little surprised/relieved that the FAA did a really great job looking at the circumstances (it was 10 years ago) and making a decision. I worried for a while but I'm glad that it's all figured out and I no longer have that hanging over my head.

From what I can understand, this is essentially asking what could cause a situation where an airplane could reach a speed that it could safely climb out on one engine, but that speed is yet below the speed at which the pilot should rotate during a normal takeoff.

Imagine the following case: during a cross country in a single engine airplane you find a low cloud ceiling with clear sky above it. In this case you could go VFR over the top of the clouds but in case of engine failure you would need to make an emergency landing without visibility (it actually happened to my former instructor but luckily he recovered the visibility 400 feet above ground). However I usually see pictures or videos of other pilots doing exactly that when low ceilings are found during a flight.

For the flight plan to activate all of these devices must be disconnected when you press the activate or close button.

Today was my first flight into my private pilot journey and I have to say it was awesome and I loved every minute! The FBO I work at has a Piper Warrior and a 172 Skyhawk and we flew the Warrior. It was pretty turbulent though, with the wind varying between 18-24kts. Is that actually turbulent to experienced pilots or did it just seem that way to me because I'm brand new in the cockpit? Surprisingly, it made me feel somewhat motion sick and I've never been motion sick on planes before either. 

Despite the excitement, I'm worried about getting my medical, because two years ago right out of high school I applied to get my medical at a local airport in my town and got denied because I was taking anti-anxiety medicine at the time and because the airman said something was wrong with my eyes when we did eye tests. What is funny is that when I went to get my eyes checked afterwords, my eye doctor, who's actually a pilot himself, said my eyes were fine. I haven't taken the medication for over 2 and a half years and have been cleared by my doctor to be off it. It's an unfortunate circumstance because I was a high schooler at the time and I never considered what an impact anti-anxiety medications would have on getting my medical. I'm hopeful though, because the FAA a few months after the denial sent me a letter to try again?

As far as I'm concerned, important things were:

* doing a mock checkride or two with a CFII, my instrument flying was rustier than I expected
* flying with non-IFR rated pilots. I asked a former student (now PPL) of mine to come along so I could teach him instrument flying while I flew a bunch of approaches. This helped me to become comfortable teaching while dealing with the airplane/ATC/approach briefing/weather etc
* read the PTS, be familiar with it, know what is expected of you

Things I needed to refresh:

* 91.175, I got some nice mnemonics from another CFII for remembering the conditions under which you can descend below DA/MDA
* circling minimums (e.g. what's that inverted-""C"" in the RNAV (GPS) 26 KTCY on the FAA approach plate?)

I recently flew from PHLI to LAX in a Boeing 757-200 (Delta Airlines). The leg room in coach was a bitch, unbelievable, but anyways ...

I had the famous middle seat and it was already pitch black, so I could not see outside, but I could feel that the pilot was on the breaks when lined up and going to full throttle, but I expected him to be longer on the breaks, the runway at PHIL is not the longest and it was a full flight.

The take off roll was amazingly short, so short that for a moment I thought ""what the heck is he doing"" ...

But we took off with no problem, I also could hear that he had 2 or maybe even 3 notches of flaps in for take off, also surprising to me.

I’ve been offered a really good starting pay of low 50k. It’s everything one could ask for in these times however...

I’m not very passionate about the industry.

Basically, I don’t have any roots tying me down right now, nothing in my life is really fixed except my debt.

Coming out of school I will be around $60k CAD in debt which includes my student loans, credit card and car. Okay so now you have an idea of my background.

Obviously I will be finishing my undergraduate, but my question is:

Should I wait it out, start my new job and maybe make some money, kill my debt and then quit my job and do flight school?

The lawyer tells me even if we go to trial it will be an uphill battle, they could raise the fines even higher and ask for jail time, again over a speeding ticket, dont even know what to say.

At this point i'm just about ready to take the criminal speeding and have a nice day, $2700 for a speeding ticket? even more if it doesn't get dropped?
I know friends with DUI's that didn't spend that much money nor did they go to trial.

Keep in mind this is with a Lawyer and a completely clean driving record not one ticket in my life (12 years of driving), had just moved here a week before, already spent a night in jail, sold the corvette, never been stopped again, first offense ever and they refuse to lower it from criminal to a regular speeding ticket.

Will it be impossible to fly commercially now with this on my record?  Did I just kiss my future career goodbye? 

Cant wait to wrap up this year and get the hell back to CA.

209,Got Liability?," Hello All,   


  I bought a PA-28 a couple of years ago after finishing my PPL. Since buying it a few folks from work have gained interest in flying and we have formed an informal club. I don't ""rent"" the aircraft, but we all put money away for maintenance and fixed costs such as the hangar and annual inspection. I and two of the other guys that fly are A&amp;P/IA's and do all of the maintenance, and three more are ATP level pilots. Currently, I have a normal owner's policy with myself and the other low timer named and the other guys are covered by the open pilot warranty.   


A friend recently suggested that by not having the aircraft in an LCC, with club type insurance (which is substantially more than an owners policy) I may be exposing myself (and family) to alot of liability. I really enjoy my group and it certainly has eased some of the pains of ownership. An LLC isnt really a possibility without starting over with the loan process, so I am not crazy about doing that over a potentially higher interest rate. I am interested in possibly forming a proper club at some point, around my airplane and possibly those provided by other owners. In the meantime, I am curious to see if there are maybe others in similar situations that may have some kind of insight. ",flying,1570498708,Flyingwrenchbender,5,8,True,2019-10-07

I’m part of a senior aviation capstone project at The Ohio State University, and we’re studying CFI retention at Part 141 flight schools. Many instructors leave the flight school as soon as they hit their R-ATP minimums, while others leave for other flight schools.

We want to use this data to improve CFI quality of life here at OSU and at every Part 141 flight school across the country. A tall order, perhaps, but we're trying our best!

So, if there are any Part 141 CFIs out there that have 10 minutes to spare, we'd love to hear from you. If you have any questions, please email me or leave a message here if it's something you'd like to share.

230,Depression as an aspiring pilot,"I am currently in the process of completing my CPL and am preparing for my flight test. I recently began taking anti-depressants (about 3 months ago) due to feelings of flatness in my life. Overall I would say that my depression symptoms are relatively mild but so far the medication has been helpful and it may be a good idea to continue taking it. I recently went to my CAT1 aviation medical examiner and reported my use of the drug. He cleared me to fly and signed off on my medical but had included it in his report to Transport Canada. Now I have just received a letter from Transport Canada requesting further information on my condition - including a letter from my family doctor showing that I am stable after 4 months of taking the medication. They also informed me that if I continue on the medication that I will have to submit a report from a psychiatrist every 6 months to ensure that I am in stable condition. 

Now my question is - if I continue to take anti-depressants, will it limit my job opportunities with airlines in the future? One Air Canada medical examiner told me that they generally have a zero tolerance policy for these kinds of drugs which seemed kind of extreme to me. However, my aviation medical examiner informed me that he sees many pilots that are on anti-depressants, including some pilots that fly for Air Canada. So I am not sure what to believe. I have considered getting off the anti-depressants since my symptoms are quite mild and I have made several lifestyle changes to combat my feelings of depression. If it is going to limit my opportunities in the future, I will probably get off the medications. I know Air Canada uses their own aviation medical examiners when hiring new pilots, but do all of the airlines do this and would my use of anti-depressants disadvantage my hiring prospects?

""United is partnering with several of its regional United Express carriers, leading universities with established aviation programs, and training centers – including Lufthansa Aviation Training – to ensure pilots have the best opportunities to enroll in the innovative program. Current Aviate United Express partners are Air Wisconsin, ExpressJet, Mesa Airlines and CommutAir.""

Aviate seems very similar to Delta's Propel program, however, there seems to be more opportunities for pilots interested in time-building in the 135 environments. Aviate will hand out conditional job offers (CJO's) to those who are accepted into the program and require a minimum of 2,000 hours and 24 months of service at a partner regional. No word yet as to when the list of ""established aviation programs"" and 135 partners will be announced.

Hearing about the pilot shortage was really a kick in the pants and I felt if I don’t try now I never will. 

Having a degree and wanting to get started quickly I don’t think that college programs are the best route for me so I’m looking at local flight schools. 

Toronto island would be close for me however I hear they have a bad reputation especially about the owner. 

I’ve heard Brampton is great but they have a 3 month wait list. I signed up to the list. I’m also considering their CPL 14 month program. 

I’ve heard some good things about Durham and Burlington. 

Any suggestions from the r/flying community regarding training?

This was so I could learn to fly the plane more and use instruments well that I would need if an Ipad ran out of battery.

248,University Flight Education Guide (For Prospective Airline Pilots),"Good afternoon /r/flying! I've seen a few people ask questions related to going through the ATP track at a university and wanted to share my experiences and recommendations.

Let's start at the beginning. I'm going to assume you are a either brand new to the pilot profession or are working on your private pilot licence.

The first thing you should know is the ATP-1000 rule. To fly a commercial jet for an airline, you must hold an Airline Transport Certificate. This normally requires 1500 hours, but through an approved university program it can be shortened to 1000. This is the path I am currently taking and recommend to any new pilots interested in flying the airlines. It's cheaper and gets you a degree in case you don't get your medical. I also recommend getting a first class medical. You only need a third class to fly privately, but if you are going to spend thousands on trying to get an ATP, make sure you medically are able to get it too.

I am a freshman at Auburn University, originally from Florida. I just got my PPL last month and will be working on my IFR next semester. 

Over the last 2-3 years I have been researching colleges and talking to recruiters, in addition to visiting schools. These are the programs I have heard about and looked up. Research the programs yourself, and find the best fit for you. I will include links to each school as well. I will put the schools in order of what was the best fit for me. Obviously, a school at the bottom of this list might be a good fit for you, but you need to research it.

**Auburn University, Auburn AL** - https://cla.auburn.edu/aviation/professional-flight/ - Obviously the school I am going to was the best fit for me. All flight university programs are expensive, and Auburn was no exception. However, compared to similarly priced programs, this one provided the most benefits. Auburn is a public university, and though I was paying out of state tuition, it was cheaper than a lot of in-state options in Florida (we will get to ERAU in a moment). In addition, unlike many of the other schools on this list, Auburn is a large football school. In addition to getting excellent flight time, Auburn has SEC football and an incredible college atmosphere. If you are from Alabama and get in state tuition, this one is a no brainer. They have about 75 aircraft and while getting a flight block can sometimes be a hassle, once you have it I have heard nothing but great things about the CFIs.

**Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL (Also in AZ)** - https://erau.edu/ - This university is probably the most notorious on here, and not for great reasons. I honestly have a bit more of a positive view on the school, but there are a lot of drawbacks. Let's start with the pros. The school is all about aviation. If you go there, there is a reputation for excellence that the school likes to advertise. To my knowledge, they own more aircraft to train on then any other university in the country. I toured their Florida campus last year, and it is right next door to the Daytona Speedway. I liked it, it was a nice modern campus. Now the cons. ERAU by far is the most expensive school I applied to. Despite being from Florida, there was not a lot of financial aid available as they are a private school. From what I have heard from friends attending the university, ERAU has a long wait line to get flying, despite the aircraft numbers, and gives preference to ROTC flyers. Also, their culture is all aviation, all the time. Their sports are almost non-existent (Though they have a good DIII tennis team I've heard) and there is a lot less events and activities outside of aviation. I think there are better choices around, but if you are solely interested in flying, this one is known as the ""best"".

**Lynn University - Boca Raton, FL** - https://www.lynn.edu/ - Lynn University was the other flight school I visited personally. While Auburn has a nice historic campus, this school is incredibly modern. While the campus itself is tiny, it is one of the most nurturing and tech-heavy campus environments I've seen. Their flight area is a about a 10 minute drive off campus, but on campus it looks more like the headquarters of Google than a university. Each student gets a cable subscription for living on campus and Ipads are included in tuition as well. They will roll out the red carpet for you as well when you visit. Incredible people, though it is a small campus if you want a large school. There are some notable cons however. Their flight program is extremely small. I think there were 4 aircraft there when I toured, with 2 more on order. It also is extremely expensive. While they have more financial aid, in terms of base cost it is around Embry-Riddle. Living off campus won't be much cheaper either, as they are in Boca Raton, one of the most expensive places to live in Florida. A great choice, but I personally valued the large school environment more.

**University of North Dakota - Grand Forks, ND** - https://und.edu/programs/flight-education-bsaeronautics/index.html - When I first started looking up flight schools, behind ERAU this school frequently came 2nd in various online rankings. I talked to their aviation department and heard a lot of great things. They have a large flight school, lots of investment in the program, and the price is really reasonable compared to other schools compared so far. There are some obvious cons. It is still out of state tuition and expensive for me, and North Dakota is very isolated. Obviously the winters there are no joke, but just getting to and from the school can be an incredible hassle for me too. Auburn is a rural school, but it is a 2 hour bus ride from KATL. Getting home for breaks would involve 11 hours of travel for me if I went here. However, if you are from the midwest, I've heard nothing but good things out of UND.

**Purdue University - West Lafayette, IN** - https://admissions.purdue.edu/majors/a-to-z/flight-professional-flight-technology.php - The fact I got in here still amazes me. Purdue is by far the hardest school I applied to and I was accepted straight in. This is a large school, with lots of stuff to do outside flying, 2 hours from Chicago. They have a dedicated professional flight program and a degree from Purdue is extremely marketable to employers. However, I was not accepted as a flight major, but as my second choice. It is tough to get in and the academics are rigorous. It also was pretty far for me, and to go I had to wait pretty late to get a decision.

**Arizona State University - Tempe, Arizona** - Arizona State was the largest school I applied to. It has a flight program that seems to have good reviews, and after acceptance they sent me the most emails and goodies to get me there. Their flight program is not on their main campus and in terms of cost, it was similar to UND for myself. Western fliers probably have more in depth information than I can provide.

**Western Michigan University - Kalamazoo, MI** - https://wmich.edu/academics/undergraduate/aviation-flight - The last school I sent an application to. They are expensive, far, and you have to wait to get in line to fly as a freshman. Apparently they also have a satellite campus in Florida, but I didn't look to far into it. By the time I got my acceptance letter I had already committed to AU.

**Other Schools:** These schools I also have heard about, but have not researched a lot about.

271,A Rant: To my CFI," 30 hour PPL student here; based in northern CA in the final stage of private [training.](https://training.my/) I'm 28, post college, and a career changer doing this full-time.  

I try my best to be the best student I can be. If my instructor is late or needs to cancel a lesson, that's chill. If he's low energy we can cut the lesson short. I'm not cocky, I study before lessons, I ask questions, I try and have some fun on the lesson when everything is going good. I come prepared, but I still make mistakes, and I always try to see how I can do better.

I liked my instructor at first. But as we continue our training I'm starting to resent him... I'm thinking about getting another instructor but the wait for CFI availability is about 4 weeks, and the DPE is another 3 months here, so it would set me back about 3-4 months total and **damn** I need to get this thing done by January. 

That being said I just get need to get some shit off my chest on things that **really grind my gears:**

* Try not to answer your phone multiple times during a lesson
* If your going to tell your student the wrong information, that's fine, we all make mistakes; but don't act like we are the idiots when you're fucking up
* Don't text saying you're going to be 15 minutes late when you're 45 minutes late
* After your student has a rough day flying, don't boast about how well you did the maneuver on the way back
* Don't talk shit to other instructors about your students in front of... your student
* If I am paying for your time: talking to the cute girl who just walked in,walked out to the ramp, or is in the hallway shouldn't be your priority
* Berating your student FUCKING SUCKS for us, and once we are rattled we usually make more mistakes. I understand certain mistakes are incredibly costly, but if you yell at your student and see he is shaken-up try to calm him down rather than roasting us even harder (Unless you're doing check ride prep/stress testing). Sometimes we are going to make dumb mistakes for how many hours we have. For me, I forgot something on a checklist, got yelled at, then messed up a radio call and my instructor said ""dude get your fucking shit together"".
* Continuing from that point, If you roast your students we are going to resent you
* Try and get to know your student a little bit! The more you talk about yourself the less I really care
* If your a tough instructor **let your students know when they are doing a good job.** Be stoked if they have a good day
* Even if you are, try to have some humility and not act like you are Gods gift to aviation

That's kind of all I got. I am really frustrated with my instructor but am on a time crunch to get this damn license done.

What are you guys like as CFI's? Do you try and have fun or keep it strictly business? How aggressive do you get when correcting your trainees? Have you ever been fired by a student?

279,What I learned today- trim makes everything easier,"I'm PPL 120 hours and I'm thumping landings.  Yesterday after my longest XC yet (2.7 hours with an attitude indicator and DG failure on the outbound leg so that I couldn't use the autopilot), I bounced the landing at home and did a go around.  The next landing was OK, but as I really concentrated on my technique, I realized, this landing seems really fast.  While I had a bunch of excuses: fatigue, practice, winds; I decided an hour with my CFI would be better than any of those excuses.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 8 landings today, and- **I wasn't trimming the plane as much as I should have.**  Pushing the plane to the ground with the yoke makes for a very clumsy landing.  Trimming at the start of the downwind, abeam the touchdown point after throttle pull and flaps, at the base after next notch flaps, and early on final after full flaps makes the event SO much easier.  Then, instead of pushing the plane to the ground and trying to time the roundout, the plane is descending with proper attitude and I'm working so much less.  Then round out is by gentle back pressure and the landing feels much better.

&amp;#x200B;

Also of note: I'm a more sophisticated learner now. With 300+ landings, I am ready to discuss finetuning the events, using more finesse, more technique.  The landings today were thumping for the first few, then chirping one really well near the end.  On that one, I was gently holding the plane off, holding the nose up with increasing back pressure and Chirp chirp, just continued through the motion until the nose wheel settled. SO satisfying when the landing is butter smooth.

I'll be transitioning from the C-172 to a C-182 this winter, so landings with the heavier plane and heavier nose are going to be a big part of my future training.  This was a great way to focus on skills I will need for that training.

I know I was taught trimming after power changes, after flaps changes, and thought I was doing enough.  Nope.  It was a great hour flying and re-learning better techniques.  Thanks, Aaron CFI for the great advice!

Be well!

344,Quetions about critical angle of attack.,"I'm training for my CFI at the moment and was wondering about the critical angle of attack and if it EVER changes? 

I'm pretty sure it changes with flaps extended, does it change with airspeed?  I've read yes and no.  For example, on a power-off stall, we are going much slower, full flaps, power is idle, and we stall at a much lower pitch angle.  For a power-on stall, we are going a bit faster, no flaps, full power, and we have to pitch up to a much higher angle for the airplane to stall.  

My questions are: Does the critical angle of attack change with anything (flaps, airspeed, etc)? Does the critical angle of attack change for those different stall maneuvers? If it does change is it due to flaps, airspeed, or power setting? I know pitch does not mean angle of attack but the change in pitch is so drastic between the two, does the power-on stall create it's own relative wind due to the higher power setting?",flying,1570806985,Prolatrevol,20,3,True,2019-10-11

One, somethings up, two, it's wired to show the charge from either the battery or the alternator. As there is no other indication in the plane in regards to how many volts you're running.

According to what I understand altimeters show a higher than true altitude on cold days and a lower than true altitude on hot days, so even if you adjust your pressure setting your altimeter will be off because of the temperature. This just doesn’t make sense to me. If the pressure is different from the temperature shouldn’t that also effect the barometer to tell you what pressure setting to use? So if the air is 15c, the barometer shows 29.92 and then temperature increases to 16c shouldn’t the pressure the barometer shows also increase?",flying,1570814536,moderngamer327,11,6,True,2019-10-11

I received my private pilots license (VFR) several years ago but have not flown very much recently. When I trained, I exclusively used paper VFR maps to navigate. I might have used Sky Vector once or twice to plan, but again, everything was primarily done with paper maps.

I'm in the process of taking some refresher lessons at an airport near me using a new flight school and new instructor. The instructor told me to buy an iPad and that we'd be using ForeFlight for charts and other data. He said that he doesn't train using paper maps anymore and that ForeFlight is far superior. I expressed surprise to him about this because I was trained using paper maps not THAT long ago. He said that people just don't fly anymore using paper charts.

I am conceptually okay with using ForeFlight and the features it offers do seem pretty cool. Further, I trust this instructor. However, to say that people just don't use paper maps anymore and basically everything is done via a tablet is a significant departure from how I was trained, so it caught me off guard.

- Morning of the CR I found out that my plane was grounded and I was switched to another plane that I had never flown before. Yikes! I freaked out a bit. Not only was it a newer C172, I would have to redo my W&amp;B on my XC plan. Luckily I had time to head to the airport, check out the plane, and do a couple of solo laps around the pattern 

- Vacuum pump failed halfway through the CR. Thus couldn’t do any of the instrument maneuvers and had to complete those a week later. However I had to do several maneuvers after the pump failed - the DPE asked me if I wanted to. Thus I ended up doing my steep turns with no attitude indicator to tell me my bank was good, and no heading indicator so had to rely purely on a lake I had picked

- I flew far worse than I did the last few weeks. It was probably nerves. Couple of landings were hard because of flaring a bit early. On the power off emergency landing was about to land short and should have gone around. Approaches were not as stable as should have been. Didn’t trim enough. DPE shouted at me a couple of times and I was sure I had failed. But I didn’t. Point is, you can make mistakes. In fact, quite a few mistakes. Just acknowledge them when you realize, correct them if possible, and move on to the next thing. As long as you’re a safe pilot, you actually have quite a large margin of error

Lets say I am doing this procedure own nav(for practice or checkride purposes). I'm inbound to the VOR on the 316 radial To, is it required to fly out West to the hold , then proceed back to the VOR and make the initial turn outbound?

Or is it legal to overfly the VOR on the 316 radial, continue outbound on 316 within 10nm, then a teardrop to go back outbound on 136. Then make the final procedure turn within 10nm(181) and back left and go to minimums? Input is appreciated",flying,1570866532,flytoeatTool,14,3,True,2019-10-12

376,The other side of the United Jumpseat issue,"From UAL ALPA

""It has been brought to our attention that the pilot representatives at Skywest (IBT and SAPA) have posted letters via social media to their pilots encouraging them to start denying United pilots the jumpseat. These letters are filled with misleading and inaccurate information. They also claim that the UAL MEC has been officially notified of their upcoming actions. This is patently false. We have not had any communication with IBT since last December or SAPA since last September when they last threatened to disrupt the United operation.

The new UAX/UAL jumpseat boarding priority outlined in Flt Ops Bulletin 19-194 will become effective on October 15. Please see the Oct 9 MEC update re-posted below for more details. These new agreements are the result of multiple LEC and MEC resolutions and the culmination of years of work.

When we began to research this issue, we discovered that documented jumpseat agreements did not exist between United and the UAX airlines. All eight of our UAX carriers were given new reciprocal jumpseat agreements to sign on May 14, 2019. Within 30 days of receiving the agreements, five of these carriers signed. These new agreements align the UAL/UAX jumpseat agreements with industry standard agreements at AA/American Eagle and DAL/Delta connection. We would like to thank the ALPA representatives at ARW, CMT, TSA, and XJT for their leadership working with us to improve jumpseat benefits. 

There are three remaining UAX carriers that have not yet signed: SkyWest, Republic, and Mesa. Due to this failure to sign, these three carriers technically do not have a reciprocal jumpseat agreement with United Airlines. This is contrary to the recent information sent out by the IBT and SAPA. Instead of cutting them off completely, as some believe we should, they were afforded the courtesy of being categorized and prioritized as ""other airline.""

If and when each of these ""non-exclusive"" UAX carriers sign the agreement, they will be moved up into a higher boarding priority and join GoJet in the non-exclusive tier. In addition, they would be included in the upcoming UAX electronic check-in/listing and international jumpseating (ICASS) on UAL.""",flying,1570881646,Kelvin-Helmholtz,89,11,True,2019-10-12

378,Find me a plane service?,"So I'm training for my PPL right now, and currently paying a very painful $210/hr for a 172N. This is without the instructor fee. Fuel is $6.50/gal right now, so this fee is just...really hard to stomach. Add in the fact that there are 18 students and one plane between us (School owns 2, but seems like one is always in the shop) and finding open spots is an exercise in frustration.

I'm looking into buying my own IFR ready 172 so that I can more easily finish my training, and move on to instrument and commercial training. Definitely open to a 182 as well, given that I'd like to haul the family around from time to time. The problem is that I live on an island and used planes are basically impossible to find here. I've been asking around and nobody has any leads whatsoever. So what I need is to probably find a plane state-side and then have someone deal with A&amp;P to inspect it, do their own look over, give me a report, and ferry it to me if I buy it. 

Problem is that between work, family, flight lessons (1-hour commute each way), etc... my time to scour through online listings is stretched thin, and even if I did have time, I have no idea what I'm looking at anyway.

So, the question is - Is there a service somewhere out there that will just...find me a plane? Maybe they ask me what I'm looking for, I tell them, and they do the leg work? 

Probably a big ask, but given my location and the lack of inventory here, I don't know how else I can possibly find something to buy.",flying,1570893545,Special_Kev,21,2,True,2019-10-12

Likely an easy question I have here for you:

If you are making your way direct in to a VOR, how do you go about turning around to begin your back course in preparation for the Procedural Turn (assuming one is required) to conduct an approach.

Not following? I thought that may be difficult to understand via text, so I bring you this picture:

PICTURE:

Here you have Joe Schmoe looking conduct a VOR approach into College Station. When approaching from the North East, Joe here has conducted something of a Tear Drop turn around to begin flying the 100 degree radial outbound.

422,Flair Update and Checkride Long Write-Up: CPL ASEL KSLC NOTE: CHECK YOUR LOGBOOKS!,"Hey there, everybody! Recently passed my CPL ASEL checkride out of KSLC! After a month of delays from weather, scheduling, and stress (I'll talk more about this later in the post), I was able to start and complete my CPL Checkride. This is a long write-up, but I think the paragraphs about checking your logbooks and stressed flying (at the bottom) are worth looking over. 

Starting off, I was supposed to to start the checkride in the afternoon. Woke up around 0800 to start studying and received a text from the DPE saying that his morning cleared up and that we could start early or wait til the afternoon. I was instantly worried, because I knew the student who was supposed to do the same flight test with the same DPE that morning. I text the DPE saying that I could be there in an hour or so, while texting the student and his CFI to see what happened. Did he fail so soon? Is there something I should prepare for? 

**\*CHECK YOUR LOGBOOKS!\*** I get to the airport and the reason this student was not able to start his checkride is because, during his instrument training and certification, his CFI did not annotate that his hood time was under 61.129 (a) (3) (i). The DPE said that it's a dumb little rule that the FSDO is really starting to hammer the DPE's on. I'm a 141 student and, to our knowledge, I didn't need this annotation in my logbook. So, we were able to knock out my checkride. 

Back to my checkride. Started off very relaxed. I'm friends with most of the CFIs at my school and the DPE gets along well with these instructors. So we spent a few minutes sharing stories, grabbing coffee, and ensuring future checkride students have that 61.129 annotation in their logbooks. When we started, we briefly covered CPL limitations. Can I fly someone in their plane and be compensated? Can I supply the plane and fly people for compensation? What operator certificate would I need to do commercial operations with a GA aircraft?

**AIRCRAFT REQUIREMENTS:** Went over ARROW, AV1ATE, airspace requirements, TCDS, STC, etc. One question that stumped me was, ""When does Class E airspace become active?"". I've never heard that question worded that way, but what he was getting at was, ""When are VFR aircraft not authorized within Class E airspace?"". I just said, ""When the flight visibility is below VFR minimums"" and we moved on. He brought up a point that some commercial operators will do, and that is they will tell you a piece of equipment is malfunctioning on the aircraft, at the last moment. The operator wants you to fly the aircraft to another airport to have the equipment repaired/replaced, can you do this? The equipment in question was the Mode C transponder and we're at a Class B airport. I said I would call the tower and put in a request to fly out of the Class B airspace and fly to an airport to get the transponder replaced. Covered 91.103 and 91.205, MEL, and KOEL. 

**FLIGHT PLAN:** We moved on to the flight plan discussion of the checkride. My flight was from KSLC to KBOI. This is the route I flew to knock out my 250nm solo flight and so I felt confident about that route already. I brought my Surface laptop with the flight loaded on ForeFlight and we followed the route talking about different airspaces, markings, altitude restrictions, special use airpsace regulations along the way. The flight was VFR so he threw in a couple scenarios along the route. he pulled up a picture of a thunderstorm in the path, a picture of low visibility and wanted to know what I would do. On the low visibility picture, he said the visibility dropped to 1sm. I said I could continue the flight in Class G airspace and to make a point to avoid flying over the populated areas (The low visibility section was in an area where Class E started at 700 AGL). On the thunderstorm picture, he asked what side should I fly to avoid the thunderstorm. Me, being pretty dumb, thought he was asking what side of the picture I would fly. So, I said I pass the thunderstorm to the right. He paused and said, ""Right, we're gonna call that the downwind side"". Because you don't want to fly the upwind side because that's where hail has the most potential to ruin your day. 

**FLIGHT PLAN CONTINUED:** My route got near a TFR along the way to KBOI. The TFR wasn't active during the notional time of passing. But it brought up a point he wanted to discuss. He pulled up a picture of an F-18 and an F-15 and asked, ""You see this off your wing, what do you do?"". I said I would follow the aircraft, rock wings, flash lights, squawk 7777. These weren't the answers he was looking for, so he asked, ""What one thing could save 90% of all marriages?"". I laughed and said, ""Oh, yeah. Communication."". So, I said I'd talk to them on guard, 121.5, and see what they wanted me to do before the situation escalated any more. He then went into a discussion about how most intercept situations could be avoided if you just talk to the interceptor on guard. The only time you realistically should be flashing lights/rocking wings is if your radios are broken and you have no way of talking to the intercepting aircraft. The time you should be squawking is when instructed to do so, or as a courtesy heads-up to ATC as a notice to controllers to let them know, ""Hey, I'm being intercepted. If I start to get near your airspace or need to fly through your airspace, here's the reason why"". 

**FLIGHT PLAN CONTINUED:** After the intercept discussion, we followed my flight route and found a spot that was near some restricted airspace. He threw a thunderstorm in front of my flight path and I elected to fly north (Away from the thunderstorm and the restricted airspace). Then he threw another thunderstorm on the north side, so I started flying east. Then he threw another storm on the east side, leaving the only route of escape to the south and through the restricted airspace (Altitude limits were surface to 17,999' MSL and way out of the way for a C172S). He asked if I could fly through the restricted airspace to avoid thunderstorms. I said yes. He said, ""But it's restricted"". We then went in to talk about 91.3, or PIC authority. Pretty much the point he was making is that a Student Pilot in a C152 has the same PIC authority as a 747 Captain. Do what you gotta do to ensure the safety of you, your passengers, and your aircraft.

**THE FLIGHT PORTION:** We went over the Pre-Flight actions, passenger brief, and the plan of action for the checkride. He needed to see two visual waypoints from my flight plan. So I quickly altered the flight plan to follow the I-80 VFR transition route. This route is used for VFR aircraft going to KTVY and departing from the active runway. I chose a couple visual reference points during the transition route and told him the times we should pass them. Both were passed within 6 mins of takeoff and were within standards to pass. He then said we're going to deviate to KTWF and I need to show him my time, distance, and fuel calculations to get there. We were flying a G1000 equipped C172S, so I did a direct KTWF and told him the time, distance, and fuel used indicated on the top of the MFD and we continued to the maneuver portion. Started off with steep turns, immediate transition to slow flight, then immediate transition to power off stall, immediate power on stall, immediate accelerated stall, chandelles to the left and to the right, three steep spirals, what was left of the altitude we used as an emergency descent, and he gave me the option for lazy eights or eights on pylons. We were already close to the surface after the emergency descent, so I said lets just do the eights on pylons since we're here. 

**THE FLIGHT PORTION, LANDINGS:** After the maneuvers, we went over to the airfield at KTVY and started doing landings. Started off with short field landing and immediate transition to soft field takeoff. Moved to a soft field landing with a normal takeoff. We did a soft field takeoff from KSLC so that was already good to go. He asked if I was warmed up enough to do the power off 180. I said I felt great and let's get it done. I suggested the 1,000 footers and he said, ""Yeah, that works"". So, came in on the downwind, pulled the power abeam to the designated landing point and glided down. I was way high on short final. I started manipulating the flaps to 10 degrees, slipping here and there until I got into ground effect. I was still a few hundred feet away from the landing point and airspeed was dropping. I started to walk the flaps out, so that the increased lift would carry us down to the landing point. Once we passed over the  point, I decreased the flaps and we did a pretty decent landing within 50' after the designated landing point. He said I should make a video on how to do a power off 180, because a lot of people input flaps or get set at an attitude and don't alter their aircraft to ensure a precision landing and bust the landing. We circled around the traffic pattern one more time and did a go-around before heading back to KSLC. Did a normal landing at KSLC and that was the end. 

I flew this checkride in the right seat, because I intend on becoming a CFI. So, it made sense for me to be able to do all of these maneuvers from the right seat before I start CFI training. The transition from the left seat to the right seat was definitely strange on that first flight. After a couple hours of landing and doing maneuvers, it clicked. Just my opinion, but if you can do it, I'd suggest practicing right seat flying during your CPL training so that you don't have to spend more money than you have to, during CFI school. 

**LAST POINT ON STRESS:** So, at the top, I mentioned that one of the reasons I delayed my checkride was due to personal stress. I don't want this to sound like a sob story, I'm just sharing my experience.

 In one week, I left my job to focus on flight school, I started selling my house and found some issues that I needed to fix before it could be sold, family drama, and prepping for the CPL checkride. I feel like I normally thrive on stress. But, this was overwhelming and I definitely noticed that this much stress was affecting my flying. I couldn't do a steep turn to save my life, I was missing checklist items, and my power off 180 was beyond ACS standards by 100-300'. For the last two years, I've been flying most every morning, repairing aircraft til midnight during the week, followed by studying and college on the weekends. I hadn't been taking any breaks or vacations to relax during that time and really felt like a candle that was burning at both ends. The instructors were noticing that I was off my game and were suggesting that I reschedule the checkride. I agreed and took a week off to deal with those stresses that were affecting my flying. After a week, I went out with an instructor to demonstrate the maneuvers. They were still a bit off, but were within standards. 

A week later, I had my checkride and I feel like I really nailed those maneuvers. We have all of these lessons telling us to assess not only the aircraft, weather, etc, but to also assess ourselves. I never thought stress would be one of those things that would have that much of an effect on me or my flying. Anyway, the point I'm making is that it's okay to take a break every once and awhile. If you're too stressed, tired, or whatever, don't feel like you have to take that flight. Fortunately, my flight concern was just a checkride and relatively low stress, compared to flying an approach in poor visibility IMC in a fast aircraft full of passengers. I'm using this personal experience as a lesson on managing stress in my personal life so that it does not affect my professional life.

424,I crimped two wires and now I have ADS-B! - Tailbeacon Installation Report,"Received my Tailbeacon this week.  Had a pre-order but they came in stock at Sportys.  So I canceled my pre-order and ordered from Sportys.  Went out the airport Thursday to install it.

Removed the rear position light / strobe, which I'm actually kind of sad about because it was an expensive OR500, and now I just have a position light and no rear facing strobe, but no rear facing strobe required on a 67' M20F.  The Tailbeacon install kit comes with two butt splice adapters, so I crimped the black to the ground and the red to the positive.  Turned on the power and... it powered on!

Connected to the Tailbeacon wifi, fired up the app, there are a few settings that the installation guide has you adjust, but basically the defaults are already there.  Just entered tail number and hit update.

It didn't find a transpoder squawk until I pulled the plane out and it got a GPS lock.  I taxied around the airport, and was able to see that Foreflight could see my ADS-B out through Sentry under Devices, Ownship, and that it updated the squawk immediately when I changed it.

So happy that I am now ADS-B Out compliant!  So sad that I have an unairworthy plane!  Time to do the paperwork and find an IA to inspect it so I can get back in the air...

The hardest part of the install was the paperwork.  Had to placard the nav lights (ADS-B out requires nav lights on)... the placard is (included in the kit), print out and add a supplement to the POH (not included in the kit), and file a form 337.  A sample form 337 is on uAvionix website, and you can pretty much just copy and paste the form.

uAvionix also has a search function to find a ""qualified installer"".  I used this to find an IA to inspect my work and file the 337 for the Tailbeacon STC.  Both the guys in Vegas responded to me, but I went with the guy that got back to me first.  He charged me $300, and it was probably the easiest $300 he ever made.  Showed up to my hangar 9AM, I showed him my crimps, that it powered on, and that the app detected it, my placard and POH supplement.  I had already sent him the filled out 337, so he signed two copies, one for me and one for the FAA.  Total time probably 30 minutes.  He said that all he had to do to get on the qualified installer list was do an online course at uAvionix website.  He also wrote an airframe entry in the airframe logbook and was on his way.

Went for a test flight climbed up to 10500 and called up LA center for flight following.  Asked them if they could see my ADS-B, and they replied affirmative.  Ran an ADS-B report, nothing was highlighted in red, so everything looks good.

TLDR; If you can find one, Tailbeacon will give you ADS-B out and you can pretty much install it yourself in 30 minutes.",flying,1571006822,Santos_Dumont,19,38,True,2019-10-13

431,PPL at 17 years old: Checkride Passed!,"Passed my PPL checkride today! Originally was scheduled for 8/28 but after some bad luck with maintenance and weather, 6 reschedules later brought me to today.

Finished my flight plan before flying out from DYL to SMQ to meet up with my examiner--it was a perfect day for the flight with clouds scattered at 080 and above--and we promptly began the oral.

Went very smoothly-we covered all of the topics from Preflight Prep and on and covered some of the basic inop equipment requirements, which was nearly all scenario based. He was very insistent on spin knowledge, and had many stories to tell--a theme throughout the checkride--which put me at ease.

I did mess up two questions: a question on atmospheric stability and one on runway surface condition reports (which he said was a bit of a bonus but very good to know) and then we went up for the flight.

Followed the ACS closely for the diversion and then maneuvers, and made some great landings before we parked at Somerset and he printed up my temp!

Some background: I have been flight training for about 2 years since an adventure flight nearly the same day 2 years ago. I quickly fell in love with flying and started scheduling ""real lessons"" later that year in late December 2017 and began training more often in January-May 2018 once I had a job and was making money to support it. However in the past 12 months I have done most (42ish out of 63ish hours) of my flying. If you are a teenager that is dead-set on doing what I did, I would have saved my money over the past year and a half and would have started taking lessons around January or February of last year. I switched types about 10 hours in, and I hardly remember much from those first 10 hours. I flew much more than I had to to get my PPL but in retrospect a checkride in 60 hours isn't all that bad when it was this spread out between lessons.

Next step is off to college to do IR-CFII, but for now I am going to enjoy this ""license to learn"". And to all the people my age: it is certainly possible to do it as I did it but if you take away 2 things from it, keep a grounded study habit and try to save instead of compulsively spend for flight training: I would have been better served going from 0-PPL in 6 or 8 months rather than 2 years.

436,When is the right time to stop saving and start getting my PPL?,"Hey everyone, recently I read a post about budgets but since it didn't apply to my situation I decided to post this question. Since this is going to be a long text, the TL,DR is: Saved money for my license only to find out that I will be flying overweight most of the time (C152) and if I go for a C172 would leave me needing to delay flying like 6 months or fly only once a week. 

So, longer version, little background, I live in Spain so I'm in EASA territory, I really don't know how learning differs from other countries though... In any case, I'm 36 and I never got the chance to pursue this dream until recently so I started saving for it, since my usual family expenses don't leave room to rush decisions and I don't like asking my bank for credit I decided to save the whole amount so I wouldn't have to worry about having to pause for a few months in order to save more money. Anyway, I managed to save like 90% of what flight schools usually ask around here so I figured I could start ground school for a few months and that remaining 10% would be saved by the time I need it. Nothing special here, right? That was until I decided to take a discovery flight with the potential flight school. 

All the schools I asked use C150/152 for training and I am in no way a thin guy, 230 lb, I am on a diet but I would still be a tight fit but I hoped that the instructor would compensate this only to find out that he is even larger. There's clearly a shortage of instructors, around here everyone prefers to fly ultralight sports aircraft and this flight school has been around for more than 50 years... that's uncommon around this parts and the instructor really inspires confidence. I have no doubts that this would be the perfect school despite being like a 1 h drive when I have another flight school 15 min from my house, this second one has very, very, very little activity and inspires very little confidence. It would also be a C150 so no gain here. 

During the discovery flight not only it was very uncomfortable flying on the c152 but I was aware the whole time that we were overweight or we would be during long sessions with full tanks, so I asked about a different plane and they offered me a C172S I believe (C172 family for sure) but of course, with a price increase that if I stick with my plan now I would be around 70% instead of 90%, not a lot and I could start ground school now too but would most likely end up having to stop sometime waiting for cash reinforcements specially if I end up needing additional hours because all those prices the schools gave me were the standard 45 hour rate. 

I was thinking about flying once a week but I'm starting to think that such spacing would make learning slower and would likely end up needing more than those 45 hours... 

Anyway, how many hours do you think I would need if I only fly once a week? Or should I just wait... say... 6 months and go in full force? I mean, is it common to need more than 45 hours? I could get over the fact of flying in a very tight space but flying overweight just doesn't make me feel safe at all, specially when one of the doors, my door, opened when returning on a very very bumpy discovery flight (20/25 kts gusts, the instructor asked me if i was sure that I wanted to fly under those conditions, didn't know what I was going for)

441,"Looking at flight schools, wondering if these are red flags?","Just looking for an opinion as to if this sounds right or if I'm dealing with something weird here.

I started flying when I was 15 years old but never finished my PPL, I'm 30 now and trying to get back into it. Shopping for schools has been tough, a few places not contacting me back, etc. The AME I went to said it's because the schools in the area are so overloaded they've got weeks or months backlog just to book lessons and recommended this school to me because they are in a less busy area and at an uncontrolled field.

I went and talked to someone, their prices are surprisingly cheaper than the other schools which they claim to be because they ""make money off of selling jet fuel and the training is just for fun"" I can buy that, but there were a couple of other things that seemed off to me.

- I have an old David Clark headset (10-13, I think is the model) from when I flew in High School it's not ANR and now that I'm a bit older I'd like to be conscience of my hearing so I've been shopping for a good ANR headset. However, the person I talked to at the school (not an instructor) said they don't allow ANR headsets for training because they want you to hear the engine. Is this normal?

- The other thing I thought was strange is that they don't keep you with the same instructor, there's two full time and two part time instructors and they give you ""whoever is available"", he even said certain instructors won't do certain parts of the training (for example one instructor won't fly at night at all). I switched instructors quite a bit when I first started flying for various reasons and I felt like this really hindered my progress.

Looking for any opinions, I'm likely going to start my training here because it's the only place I've been able to book a lesson and I'm ready to get back into flying.

I used the advice I was given, including u/dash_trash's bio. Ripped it right out of the comment he made. I had pictures of me in a headset and next to the plane. I joined FAT, and I attended meetups. One person had said if you want to fish, you gotta go to the lake.  


So I went to the lake. Big time!  


I'd love to tell you that I'm engaged to the tailwheel pilot of my dreams, that we take the dogs camping in his Stinson every week and we're looking at airpark property while we plan increasingly more interesting backcountry trips over homemade breakfast.  


I am single af. But I have gotten loads and loads of interest from people who are too fat to fly in a small airplane and would like to know if I play Magic the Gathering. (Truth, I do. What I tell them: no.)  


I have done this wrong. I took your advice and clearly I screwed up the implementation somewhere along the line.

473,Recommendations on financing for private and beyond?,"Hi all. I'm close to finishing my Private license, but I've hit an air pocket. I thought I'd have enough money to at least cover PPL, and then planned on getting a loan for the rest (my aim is to become a commercial pilot) but have fallen well short. I work full time in the aviation industry already (FA for a major US airline), make decent money, but it's not enough to cover flying on a part time basis (other major obligations).

Now I've had to move up the loan process to have the rest of PPL covered as well. I've been researching on what a right fit would be, but I though I'd also ask you guys since I'm sure there's people here who got their classes financed.

I'm stuck between if I want a student loan or a personal loan. What would be advisable? And any specific institutions that you'e dealt with that you can recommend? I'm also looking for somewhere that my flight school can send my bill directly instead of the institution giving me money (so a personal loan sort of leaves this out). I go to Aviation Adventures in Manassas, VA if that makes (preferably) a student loan process easier.

486,High School Graduate Seeking Advice,"This upcoming May of 2020 I will be graduating from High School.

Ultimately, I want to become a commercial/cargo pilot.

I have been looking around the internet for answers to questions such as, ""Which branch of the military should I try to become an officer in to A) get a multi-engine pilot license and B)Wrack up the most non-combat flight hours possible. 

And moreover, once I get out with a number of years of service and hopefully a significant amount of hours, where should I go? I understand that it's a deeply subjective and nuanced question, but I'm sure that any pilots(or those in adjacent but aviation-related positions) reading this can at least speak to their experience with the airline(s) that they have worked for, and then hopefully what they have heard of others.

And if nothing else, I make this post to get direction, as to who or what I can seek out in person or online to best answer my questions.

TL;DR: Next fall I'm going to Uni for a Bachelor's degree in chemistry, and I plan to join an ROTC branch to get a pilot slot in said branch.

-What airline should I go to(based on your experience) after this?

4,An Analysis: Getting the PPL,"I've been rather interested in flying for some time, and as I mentioned in a previous post I went out for a discovery flight a couple weeks ago and have been hooked pretty hard.  Problem is, making a decision on where I wanted to train.  At the very end of this, I'll be asking, ""What should I do, Reddit?""

I selected two options, and for this exercise they'll be named ShinyFly and HoleInWall.  

ShinyFly has a spiffy website that spells out their recommended training program, and all the costs associated with it (aside from personal equipment and tax).  Their recommendation is 30 hours of Instruction, and then 17.5 hours of Solo and 2.5 hours of Simulator.  Ground School clocks in at 15 hours.  They also have a club with an up-front fee, and then a monthly after that, you can drop out any time.  The club gets you access to lower instruction costs as well as cheaper aircraft rentals.  They've got a lot of 172s and 152s available, all of which are in pretty good condition.  

Using this as my baseline to compare, I then took a look at HoleInWall. Definitely not as fancy, there's no real frills to anything, but you can't beat the to-the-pointedness about their stuff.  I noticed their own club has a much steeper join fee, their monthly is also heavier and you *have* to purchase one year of membership when you join.  Don't need it to train, but if you get it, their rental fees are incredibly reduced in comparison to ShinyFly, especially since their fleet is smaller, though much, much more varied. Also, they don't have a simulator, so I'd need to use ShinyFly's simulator to save those hours.  Finally, while ShinyFly's 152s have GPS, HoleInWall doesn't.

Also for fun, I calculated how much it would cost without ground school from choosing to use Kings, Sporty's or Gleim online courses and my pilot friends.

*Table1.*

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see in Table 1, there's a very large difference between the club and no-club options.  But it does seem cut-and-dried, doesn't it?  I mean, while the lack of GPS on HoleInWall's 152 is gonna be a bit of a pain, it can be flown around.  I mean, it's not like people have never done that before.  Their price can't really be beat...or can it?

&amp;#x200B;

That pilot friend I mentioned earlier suggested the idea of looking at buying my own 152, and as I'm an A&amp;P it wouldn't be much of a stretch to care for it myself.  Browsing around various websites, I ran across a 152 that actually has a pretty low-time engine and is listed fairly cheep.  Catch is, no ADS-B installed yet.  For 16k, it's not a bad option of a plane, just needs a bit of work.  Additionally, it has the MOGAS STC, which allows it to use good ol' automotive gasoline--the cost being flipped to the engine overhaul side.  Whatever, I could be rid of it by then, or I might just do the overhaul myself.  As far as the ADS-B is concerned, I'd also do the mod myself--I've got access to the tooling I need, and for anything that gets a bit beyond my skill level, I have a secret weapon: Homebrew.  I have a few buddies that would help for that price.  ADS-B would end up costing around 2300 to do, at that point.

Problem gets to be insurance and parking.  After talking to a few people, I settled on 1200 annually, though I'm still not sure about that.  Parking would have to be just a tie-down on the grass.  Not the best option, but we're going budget here.  Also, did a bit of research of what I'd need for every hundred hours or so on the aircraft as well as the fuel.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Budget Item|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|Cessna 150G (Fuel burn 7G/hr)|16,000|
|GDL 82|1,849|
|GDL 39|499|
|Grass Tie-Down|35/month|
|Insurance|1200/yr|
|Oil (6 Qt Tank)|5.85/Qt, 28.66/filter|
|100LL|5.21|
|91 Unleaded|3.19|

*Table 2*

&amp;#x200B;

I decided not to bother with the materials for lubes and any hydraulic servicing required, since those are rather negligible costs anyways to me.  I know I'm missing an air filter in there somewhere as well, but we're doing this quick-n-dirty again.  From my (very) brief perusal of the maintenance manual, there will every 100 hours or so you'll go through 12 quarts of oil and 2 oil filters. (Correct me if I'm wrong, of course.  I need to study it deeper to just to be sure, as well as make sure I have the most up-to-date manuals.)  I decided to see what the cost would be if I flew 100 hours/year, or 200.  This time theft is set to 7.125%, local.

&amp;#x200B;

||100 Hrs/year|200 Hrs/year|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total Cost (100LL)|$5394.51|$89169.02|
|Total Cost (Unleaded) |$3982.14|$6344.28|
|Per Hour (100LL)|$53.95/hr|$45.85/hr|
|Per Hour (Unleaded)|$39.82/hr|$31.72/hr|

*Table 3*

&amp;#x200B;

This looks a lot better, but then we have to think about the combined costs of tables 1, 2 and 3. In the end, the total cost of year 1 owning my own plane but doing lessons in it with 100 flight hours for the whole year would be $24,475.14 versus $13,015.02 being in HoleInWall's club.  It would take four years of flying at that pace to beat out  HoleInWall.  

On the other hand, if I decided to fly for 200 hours each year, that would flip by the end of year two--$36,115.02 flying with HoleInWall vs $33,181.56.

So how much am I gonna fly, anyway?  And what happens if something breaks?  And for that matter, I'll need to go get my IA...

&amp;#x200B;

This is getting complex, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

Well then, hang onto your hats, because here comes the curveball.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was looking at this, one of my coworkers wandered in and had a different suggestion entirely.  

&amp;#x200B;

He currently has a hangar at $275/month, and is talking to a guy somewhere about a 172 for 23k.  It isn't ADS-B compliant yet, but he's happy to foot the cost for that, especially if he can get the cost down some more on it.  He's just looking for some guys to buy in with him, as his current partners just bought their own hangar.  He's already got one guy looking to buy in, and suggested I do so as well--he's got his IA, so between the two of us, we've got signatures down, and he's currently working on his CFI.  I'd wanna get ADS-B IN on it, so I'd foot the bill for the GDL-39 and iPad, and it would be zero problem to install it for us.  Foreflight's only a hundred bucks a year, and after the first year and I teach them how to use it, they'd be happy to split the cost.  I don't have any government takings figured in the following...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Item|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|Hangar (275/mo 3 ways)|$91.67/month  (1100)|
|Insurance|$1200/year|
|Cessna 172 (23000, 3 ways)|$7,666.67|
|Foreflight|$99/year|
|GDL-39 &amp; iPad Mini|$961.98 (w/tax. Okay, so I lied)|
|Fuel 100LL |$5/gal|

*Table 4*

&amp;#x200B;

You'll notice I don't have a line item for CFI costs.  It's really simple: There will be none.  He won't charge me anything to teach me.  I just buy the gas.  

&amp;#x200B;

Once all is said and done, at 50 flight hours for the year, I'd be sinking $12,978.64 approximately into everything, though add another 1500 if I want to go to 100 hours.  After that, cost will be around $3533 or so annually, and I'd have a plane I could take wife and kids up in.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is where the question comes in.  What would you do? And how's my math anyway?  I'm particularly fuzzy about insurance, as I can't get a quote online for that without submitting myself to receiving mailers for the rest of my life and having to wait for a phone call from an agent anyway.

24,Radio Phraseology for establishing SKED for Bass Strait Crossing? [Australia],"This might be a bit of a dumb question, but it's under ""Special Procedures"" in the ERSA so I'm giving myself some leeway for not knowing...

My question is, what would be the proper radio phraseology for establishing a SKED?

I would plan to be on Flight Following, so will ML CEN see my plan crosses Bass Strait and just expect me to report departing and advise a reporting interval?

For example, if (after establishing FF) I'm overhead Cape Otway at 2330Z and planning a 15 minute reporting schedule: ""*ML CEN, Cessna ABC, Cape Otway at 4500, tracking 123, 2 POB, further report at 45*"".

What I really can't wrap my head around is that at 1300lbs at 60kts my sink rate has to be 2kts. But if I lighten up my plane my sink rate needs to be *higher* at 60kts for this to work out.

I had the A20s while instructing and used them at the start of my airline life. I got tired of commuting with them and went looking for alternatives. I already had a pair of QC-35s for my commute and found the idea of using them up front appealing. The Avee pairs with the QC headset seamlessly and the quality is top notch. The bluetooth controller is small, has decent battery life and a very unique simple interface to control the settings.

52,Career change from nursing to aviation?,"First off, sorry about another career change post. I've been browsing this forum and other aviation subreddits for awhile now and have looked up a lot of the career change posts. I haven't really found an example of a nurse transitioning into aviation (lots of IT/engineers!). My dream growing up was to be a pilot, but in high school I decided to do nursing because of the stability. I've been a nurse for over a year now and I'm not loving it, but I could probably find a stable job that I can tolerate with my current experience (inner city ER). I'm making a little over 50k right now, and if I went to graduate school I could likely make six figures as a nurse practitioner. I just don't want to spend the rest of my life in healthcare/nursing. 

If I were to become a pilot, it seems like my best course of action would be to drop down to part time nursing (very easy to do) and complete lessons. My only potential problems health wise would be vision that is correctable and possibly sleep apnea (not diagnosed but I think I have it). My goal would be some sort of commercial flying. I'm used to shitty schedules with my nursing career so I think I can tolerate that part.

53,Too Close for Comfort,"This weekend I flew the family (wife and 2 toddlers) up to Truckee Tahoe (KTRK) from San Carlos (KSQL) in the SFO area.  The flight there was fairly uneventful aside from a delay getting in due to a disabled aircraft on the runway.  The flight home however was anything but uneventful.

The plan was to depart Monday evening at 7:00 PM.  Sunset was at 7:35, so that would put me well out of the mountains before darkness fell.  It would also allow the air to cool down enough to get the density altitude below 8k, which I had decided was my limit.  I needed to be as light as possible for the high DA departure, so I only added 10 gallons of fuel at Truckee after I arrived.  I had confirmed that I could get another night at our hotel if I needed to wait untill morning.

We had a good time Monday letting the kids ride bikes and floating down the Truckee River.  I began loading and preflighting the Cherokee 180 at 6PM.  I could tell I was pretty tired, but judged myself ok for the flight.  I got my weather briefing, which showed 15kts of headwind from the south and a slight possibility of an overcast layer at San Carlos.  I was happy to see the winds were only 15kts, as that allayed my concerns about mountain wave / turbulence.  The GFA forecast showed only scattered clouds at 1,100ft, but the SFO TAF had a broken layer at that altitude.  It's extremely common for SFO to be socked in while San Carlos is clear, so I expected clear skies for landing.  I was planning to pick up an IFR clearance once I was out of the mountains anyways, so this didn't concern me.

What I didn't do at this point was re-evaluate my fuel situation.  I had 2.5 hours of fuel on board.  The trip would take 1.3 hours in zero wind, giving a tight but ok margin.  However, I had a headwind to deal with.  Also, the nearby marginal ceilings at SFO should have been cause to plan fuel for a missed approach + alternate.  It's hard to say exactly why I didn't do this, but it was probably a combination of all the family + loading details as well as my 7PM deadline and fatigue.

We took off from Truckee at 7:15, and it went perfectly.  On climbout I managed 500FPM at Vy, which was about 75FPM better than I had calculated.  We turned on course towards Donner lake and headed west over the mountains.  The flaw in my plan became immediately apparent.  We were faced directly into the sunset.  My forward visibility was terrible.  I couldn't see much of anything to my right due to my position in the cockpit, but I could see to the left.  I flipped to the terrain page on my GNS430 and navigated via the red and yellow blotches, Foreflight, and what pilotage I could manage.  I also had my wife watch for terrain out her window.  Thankfully the air was smooth with zero downdrafts.  I breathed a big sigh of relief once we made it up to 10.5k and the terrain page was a nice reassuring black.  I trimmed for cruise and we got to enjoy some beautiful sunset views.

Once we got over the Central Valley, night fell and I picked up my IFR clearance with Norcal Approach.  They immediately informed me that San Carlos was closed due to an accident.  Pretty impressive luck to have my destination closed on both legs of my trip!  I told them I'd switch to Palo Alto (PAO) and quietly hoped the airport would re-open in time.

After getting my clearance, I ran another cruise check.  I was only making 100kts over the ground.  Based on the winds and my expected IFR route, I'd land with 45 minutes of fuel remaining.  Yikes!  The whole south bay was still reporting good VFR though, so I wasn't concerned about going missed.  I seriously considered declaring min fuel, but didn't, as I couldn't remember the exact requirements.  Clearly I should have, as any delay would have caused me to burn into my IFR reserves.  I spent the remainder of the flight stressfully watching my fuel gauges, totalizer, and ground speed while micro-managing the mixture.

I asked about San Carlos, and they told me it was a pretty serious accident and that it would be a while.  I resigned myself to a diversion.  Later I learned that a Cessna 185 had buckled one of its main gears on landing and veered into the grass. The pilot was fine.  There was a pretty decent crosswind, which I'm guessing contributed.

I was planning to shoot the GPS 31 approach into Palo Alto to make things simple for myself.  However, when the ATIS came in range I learned that the GPS 31 approach was NA at night.  Great.  That left the VOR approach and the visual.  Norcal hates the VOR approach because it screws up the traffic flow into San Jose (SJC).  They'll give it to you if you insist, but you can expect delays.  I couldn't afford delays, so I took the visual.

As I approached the field, I simply couldn't see it in the dark.  I probably clicked the lights on 6 times.  I had to use a combination of dead reckoning, pilotage, and GPS to get myself more or less on final.  Finally I found the field on 3 mile final.  After that the landing and taxi was completely uneventful.  I had 7.8 gallons remaining, or 49 minutes. 

As I rode in an Uber to pick up the car from San Carlos, a wave of fatigue hit me like a brick wall.  I was completely wiped out.  I had no idea it was that bad.  When I finally got home and put the kids to bed I collapsed and was asleep in minutes.

**Lessons Learned**

When risk factors come together, they don't add up.  They multiply:

* The high DA departure required a light fuel load, which put me at risk of a fuel emergency.
* The high DA departure and mountain terrain caused me to take off at sunset, which made me nearly blind to terrain.
* The need to leave at an exact time caused me to rush my weather briefing, which resulted in inadequate attention to the fuel implications.
* Fatigue from a full day of chasing kids and rafting made everything else worse.
* Managing kids in flight makes everything harder.
* I should have followed the GPS 31 approach in when I did the visual.  That would have been way better than blundering around looking for runway lights.
* I should have declared min fuel.  This situation is exactly what that tool is for.
* Next time I go to Tahoe with the family, I'll insist on a morning departure.  Sure it sucks to pay an extra night of hotel, but waking up fresh and departing in the morning sun would have made everything so much easier.

All together I'm pretty disappointed in myself for accepting so many risk factors.  They multiplied with each other to produce a flight that had very little margin for error.  That is not the sort of situation I want to put my family or myself in.  We made it home safely, but it was too close for comfort.",flying,1567547407,zaruthoj,127,335,True,2019-09-03

He flies a Zodiac CH601 home-built that we put together in our basement when I was younger (first flew in '03). So many great memories in that basement!

Plan is to upgrade from a rebuilt subaru engine to a Lycoming and put pontoons on it so he can fly off the lake across the road and we can fish up north (I live in Quebec, Canada).

One day I'll have my license, and my own aircraft, based out of my local strip (YSC) and we can see each other more often.

I have been interested in flying my entire life and absolutely love helicopters. I am currently serving in the military on a deployment overseas. When I return home I would like to start a degree program at a college to get my helicopter licenses. I have 3 years of college complete in an engineering degree, so I have all my generals complete. After completing a couple internships I definitely don't want to work as an engineer. I also will have GI Bill benefits to help pay my way through. I have a couple questions for those professional pilots out there on how to get started. 

1: Is there an advantage to going to a big name school to get my licenses/ratings over a smaller schools associates program?

2: Is there anything I can do while I am overseas to prepare for school? Thinking reading material, have lots of reading time.

77,Boeing 737 MAX.,"Boeing, the Industry, and the FAA, need to face up to the fact that the B737-MAX is not the same aircraft as other 737's. Even if the problem of MCAS is resolved technically, which I have serious doubts about, the pilots still deserve a complete Type Rating course on the actual MAX simulator, and not just a 50-minute iPad presentation.

And therein lies part of the problem. There are only around 12 MAX simulators built worldwide so far. The current software issues make it difficult to build any more since nobody can accurately produce a model to predict how the aircraft will behave under the relevant various conditions and scenarios. Furthermore, requiring pilots to train in the simulator (yes that's right, thus far they don't have to) would not only delay the return to service by several years, but it would also upset customer airlines like Southwest due to the phenomenal additional associated costs. That in turn would open up that can of worms that asks why more training was not required from the beginning, or whose decision it was to remove MCAS from the FCOMs—yes, that too was done. 

The FAA needs to have the courage now not to allow Boeing to murder anymore people with this airplane. Level D training needs to be required in order to operate this airplane, and MCAS needs to be proven to have the required backup and redundancy in the case of a malfunction, and not just release the aircraft with some convoluted ""bicycle escape maneuver"" out of the Wright Brothers workshop.",flying,1567601735,Johnny-Holiday,42,0,True,2019-09-04

For context, I'm looking to do this purely for recreation, maybe at some point ramping up to getting myself to fly for business meetings to a city about 300 miles away.

My situation is such that I have the time and money now, except that I'm taking a class for the next three months that will make it so that I can only reliably commit to flying once a week.  I'll be done with that (and a long Christmas vacation) on January 1 of 2020, at which point I could fly at least 2 days a week and possibly 3 or even 4.

Initially, I had thought I would just wait and start in January.  I'm in New Orleans, so I'm guessing weather won't be a huge issue in the winter, for what that's worth. Just got my medical done, and I'm working through an online ground school as well (using Sporty's, really enjoying it).  I'm second guessing, though, and wondering if I should just start now or close to it, do a less frequent schedule, then ramp up in January and finish things out.

I know starting now would cost me more since everything everyone says indicates that less frequent flying means more hours before proficiency.  That's not hugely concerning to me, since in the end I'll be flying, and that's what I'd be aiming to do anyway (just with the added cost of the instructor).

89,"Using VA benefits to obtain IFR, Commercial and CFI tickets?","Hi there! 

I've seen some questions from folks who have used VA benefits to obtain their IFR, Commercial and CFI certifications. But the ""how"" of the process has escaped my glance. Likely, someone said it so well and precisely, I missed it. Just wouldn't be expecting anything to do with the VA to be simple... :-) 

That said, I've been away from flying for a minute, so I am doing (and enjoying mind you) my penance with a kickass CFI and flight school that backs him. The school knew that I was a vet thanks to the copious paperwork, and in the process of discussing how I was going to cover costs, after I told them that I'd fund an account to simply draft from based upon cost approximations, they told me that the VA has a program to enable vets to get the certifications I mentioned. 

Has anyone used this, and what was the process? 

As info, I'm 49, and have tired of the corporate world. I'm a senior guy in the world largest consulting firm, and need a change. So when it got pointed out that the leap from private to commercial was not that complicated, I am all over it. To retire from the corporate world and chase hours as a commercial pilot, is a very enticing idea for me. 

So my goal is to get right and checked out with my private ticket, and then take the training up through commercial multi, and then pick up hours flying cargo, charter, ambulance, etc. I'm not a guy who can simply retire and do nothing. Flying around someone else's King Air, hauling whatever, seems like a great way to spend time I'd be doing either work I am tired of doing corporate wise, or leave the corporate world and do something I'd enjoy for the sake of simply enjoying it. I'm under no presumption that this is a lucrative leap. If I wanted lucrative, I'd continue rationing my soul to the corporate world. 

I digress....

Does the VA benefit for those IFR, Commercial, and CFI only apply to post/911 vets, or is it for vets in general? It would suck if only post/911. It's amazing how much less the VA can do when they start playing politics. I'm not a fan of the VA. I'm a former Infantryman, one who has hearing damage from CAS in 91, and can't even get an audiologist appointment. (the appointments always, and I do mean always, get lost. Case in point, I've requested an appointed twice a year for over 12 years, and they always disappear. The wait I was told, was 6 months. So I wait the 6 months, and no appointment on the books.

TLDR; DC sent out a bunch of audit requests to local airports and let them decide how best to audit us. It is a shit show, and there is no national standard for how to conduct these inpections.

Yesterday I received a letter from the SFO TSA asking for a bunch of personal information that I am not legally required to share with the TSA. This information request is a first step toward a CFI records inpection.

As u/putainsdetoiles suggested I contacted AOPA. One of the managers at AOPA used to work for the feds, and was familiar with these letters going out. AOPA is in the process of reaching out to the Federal Security Director to discuss how this letter is threatening to fine airmen for not having email or cell phones.

The funny thing is that when I showed them the letter, it actually cites some AOPA resources and they got a good laugh out of that.

I got a hold of one of the TSA inspectors on the phone and he said this letter is a result of a mandate from DC. They pulled 500 names from a hat and DC sent out the names they want to audit or inspect and each airport handles it from there. Mine got handled by the SFO branch and they composed and sent this letter themselves, putting the inspectors names and numbers on the back. 

The inspector I spoke to hasn't even seen these letters, he just knows they went out with his phone number on them. I told him it was BS that I should even be required to have email or cell phone to be a CFI, and even if I do (which, let's be real here) I am not legally obligated to provide it. He said that isn't required, and he laughed when I said they threatened to fine me. I gave him my name and he took me off the list. I told him AOPA is going to be in touch from here, and he seemed to agree that is a good idea.

So there you go, it wasn't a scam. It was an overzealous local TSA office on a power trip.

119,CFI Student - I have questions,"In regards to lesson plans - is there a required format or is it mostly open to how you want to make it. I know I will want to have the big parts in them - Objectives, Content, Standards, Common Errors, and References.  How about length of the actual lesson plan on the paper?  Does that really matter, or is that subject to my opinion too?

I read somewhere to grab a highlighter and go through the AIH, PHAK and AFH, read each chapter and highlight important parts.  It seems pretty effective, as I feel like I am already learning, but is there a better more efficient way?  I feel what I am doing is really good, but if there is a better way, why not do it that way.

Practicing teaching - How did you guys practice teaching?  I know that it would be best to teach in front of actual people.  Does doing dry runs help?  I have been doing so much research on HOW to prepare for CFI, someone suggested practicing teaching lesson plans like this

* Practice to yourself teaching
* Record yourself teaching 
* Teach to a real life human being (sounds scary)

Do you think that would be an effective way to practice teaching?  Again, how did you practice teaching?

Lastly, any advice?  Anyone have useful websites for deep research of topics or Reddit threads that you found useful?  It seems like so much work ahead of me, but I am kind of excited but then again dreading a long checkride.  Thanks everyone!",flying,1567702672,crazyhorse45,22,19,True,2019-09-05

122,"Hours took to complete a ""Solo"" or ""checkride"" shouldnt be posted.","I responded to a post not long ago on here and felt like more should see. I feel like on this sub people shouldn't post their hours that they Solo,  or pass their license. I understand it feels good to do low hour successful checkrides. And to tell people this accomplishment.

But in reality though I feel like most people on this sub that don't have a solo endorsement see this and compare their hours. This making some, not all. Feel unaccomplished upset with themselves.   Everybody learns at a different pace and should not compare themselves with others. Flying is no different than any other skill that you learn, some people just pick up on it faster than others. 

 For anybody reading this post and you haven't soloed yet and you see the hours that others finish. DON'T SWEAT IT. If flying is truly something you want to do you'll pass whether it's at 15 hours or 50. It's very easy to judge people in this industry based on time. 

Just from my own experience before I even passed my license for private I was always asking what hours it took others, normally not liking the answers. 

My only goal with this post is to help pilots in training not be discouraged if they have high hours without endorsements.

124,First comm failure this weekend was... interesting,"I had a checkride prep flight with my CFI this past weekend - when I got there he let me know that the first flight of the day in my plane had reported a sticky mic, they had taken a look but couldn't reproduce the problem on the ground. Decided to go fly and test the radio, with my instructor bringing a handheld in case we had any issues.

We gave tower a heads up that we might need to turn the radios off and took off. First couple of laps in the pattern were fine, but on the third lap we started randomly transmitting for a fraction of a second at a time - decided to make it a full stop and report back to mx. 

We were cleared base and had just started the turn when the PTT went full on and stayed there. CFI got off frequency and cycled the radios, fiddled with the switches, no dice. We squawked 7600 and he got out the handheld. He called up tower and let them know we were landing full stop, but was having a hard time hearing the response - at this point my eyes are on the tower and I'm looking for the light gun.  

On short final we did get a signal from the tower - steady white. If you're curious what a steady white light means in flight, let me tell you, so were we... because it doesn't mean anything. Then it changed to flashing white, which again, doesn't mean anything to an aircraft in flight. At this point my CFI look at each other like ""WTF?"" and out of an abundance of caution decided to go around since there was no one else in the pattern that we were aware of. After a couple more minutes of yelling into the handheld to figure out what they wanted us to do, we were cleared and landed uneventfully. 

I heard later that the tower had just gotten a new light gun, so the controller likely just had the filter set incorrectly. It WAS surprisingly bright and visible for the middle of the day, just not particularly helpful on this occasion o\_O",flying,1567706123,carl-swagan,32,73,True,2019-09-05

127,[Student] First Solo Cross Country,"I'm a student based at KSBM and I wanted to share lessons learned and get some feedback on my first solo cross country. I made several mistakes and learned quite a lot that I will be taking on my next one. The original plan was KSBM (Sheboygan, WI) to KJVL (Janesville, WI), then depart KJVL to KOSH (Oshkosh, WI), then back to KSBM.

The departure from Sheboygan was uneventful except for forgetting flaps until I was at cruise (4,500' MSL). I resolved that and - surprise - went faster. When I got to Janesville, I was asked to report mid-field, left downwind for 14. I got spatially disoriented and could not for the life of me envision the pattern in relation to my current heading. I finally remembered that I could use the on-course arrow to visualize 14, which I turned and instantly knew that I was west of Janesville and on an extended base for 14 and not anywhere near a downwind. I was east to do an S to get back on the downwind. That was when Janesville tower took pity on me and asked if I'd prefer to just do a straight into 22. By this time, I was perfectly abeam the approach end, so I took it and had a decent landing. I turned off and was about to ask for a progressive taxi, but anyone who's been to Janesville knows how funny that is....

I ate at Bessie's. Shout-out to their waitstaff being great! Solid food. I got the airplane set back up for KOSH and input Rockford approach. I contacted tower, taxied, and departed on 14 and turned northbound. This is where things got more interesting. Here is where I made several decisions and a few mistakes, so feedback is welcome.

As I climbed out of Janesville , I switched away from tower to Rockford about 7 miles out from Janesville. I called Rockford a few times and nobody responded. I thought was unusual, but in the meantime, I was also seeing that the ceiling was broken at about 3,000' MSL. As I continued, I realized that I would either need to stay low up to Oshkosh or find a hole. I was going direct to Oshkosh, which doesn't end up running into any notable airspace, but staying that low didn't seem like an option. I found a big hole around Fort Atkinson and climbed through it to cruise at 5,500, well above the tops. As I went, I continued calling Rockford and continued not to get anything. My biggest regret here is not troubleshooting well. I tried different frequencies, including guard. However, I didn't try anything simple like a different headset (there was one in the backseat) and trying the co-pilot's jack set.

Failing to reach Rockford or any of the Milwaukee frequencies I had noted (I feel my other large mistake was not having other Milwaukee frequencies written down), I made the decision to monitor the frequencies, make sure I stayed out of any airspace areas and go direct back to Sheboygan and obviously skip Oshkosh. I knew I could stay VFR and make it back. I did not squawk 7600 and sitting here, I wonder if I should have.

I was plenty clear of clouds on top and found a nice hole about 30 miles from Sheboygan to get back down. As I neared Sheboygan, that's when I decided to try the co-pilot's side. That worked - to my frustration and relief - and I even switched back and forth between pilot and co-pilot just to confirm - the pilot's side was still out. I'm still kicking myself. I had crosswind at Sheboygan and landed really nicely. After clearing all runways, I called Unicom again on the pilot's side and this time, it worked perfectly. I'm still not sure what happened there and my instructor is looking at it this afternoon/evening. I am 100% sure it wasn't working properly because it sounded different when I keyed the mike and it also cut out before I was done speaking. Perhaps a short or something in the talk switch?

I think I made the right decisions, except for the troubleshooting the radio and trying the co-pilot's. Anything other lessons that I'm missing out on here?

Lessons: 
Troubleshoot and remember what is in the cockpit. Make sure to isolate the problem to its source if possible.
Remember the resources you have in the plane to visualize your approaches and patterns.
Plot, plan, and write down the frequencies you will run across on your routes. You never know when they might come in handy later.
Use the auto-pilot when appropriate to give yourself time to think.

143,Negative safety culture at a pt121 cargo airline seeking advice,"I work for a vender company that loads and unloads aircraft for a major pt121 cargo carrier. I am also an instrument rated private pilot nearing completion of my commercial and taking college aviation classes including airport operations, aviation safety, and aircraft systems. Slowly over the time I have worked for this company I have been noticing a bad safety culture when it comes to ground equipment (owned by the air carrier operated by us) such as leaking hydraulics faulty brakes and various other issues that take weeks to get repaired and are often reoccurring. I have also noticed a negative safety culture when it comes to aircraft maintenance such as me reporting inoperative lights such as the landing light and having the mechanic shrug it of as no big deal and not even checking it. 

Tonight pushed me over the edge and I want to get some advice from y’all. I was loading an aircraft when some of my coworkers started complaining about it being unbearably hot inside the aircraft which is normally the case however it clicked in my head that the packs were running and I saw vapor coming out of the vents above so I felt the vents and the air was coming out cold so I then felt the vents by the floor and felt hot air blowing out. To my knowledge this wasn’t normal so I asked the most senior employee if I could go tell the pilots which he said yes. So I opened the door and waited for them to acknowledge me as to not disturb whatever they were doing and then I proceeded to tell them and they checked all knobs were on “auto” and they turned off one pack. We load a few more containers and I felt the vents again and no heat so I then go back to the cockpit and tell them that the heat stopped so the issue was probably with that pack and as I turn around to leave the door opens and the mechanic enters and I finished loading the plane. After we finished loading my boss started yelling at me about the mechanic complaining about me being in the cockpit talking to the pilots and so I calmly explained to him the situation and that I believed it was a safety of flight issue. At the end of the night I was told that I need to follow the “chain of command” and tell him first (he knows next to nothing about aircraft) and HE will report it to the airline or mechanic and I also need to stay out of the cockpit or I will be terminated I told him “okay but I won’t hesitate to do it again”.

I believe that this is a severely negative safety culture and will prevent employees from reporting problems. I also believe “the chain of command” is a severe safety issue as someone in the “chain” could forget to report it or just dismiss it as nothing when it is actually a problem especially considering I have had a superior tell me “if you find anything don’t report it” 

I believe I was right in what I did and would not do anything differently and that I need to address this issue more with both companies and possibly the FSDO what do y’all think?

Do you get burned out by Not being able to make long lasting relationships outside the workplace and not being as present for your friends and family since you might be a lot of time outside home? How do you actually handle it?
 
I’m planning on becoming a pilot but being an international student by itself is getting pretty tiring: I lived in Atlanta for 9 months to learn English, cool and all, made a ton of really cool friends, then moved to Florida to pursue a pilot career, cool, it was okay, flying is fun, then I came back to my home country to find a job. My home country is deteriorating pretty badly where the quality of life wasn’t worth the trouble of getting a job, so I decided to come back to the states for another flight school to become a cfi. I got into a college that promised me an associates degree, the first year I accomplished my CPL single and all of the ground classes for the degree (aviation law, literature, aviation safety, classes like that) but I’ve been noticing that i don’t really have close friends, the friends that I have made in the last 4 years have been like single use friends: you meet them for a period of time only to realize the unavoidable, you are just friends for a while, then everyone will go back to their home country and myself included I will eventually have to leave the US since I’m not an American nor I hold a green card. 

And I wonder if that’s the same in aviation, right inside the every day airline pilot job. A lot of changing of bases, a lot of other people changing bases and changing to other areas in the same company, where yourself left without any long lasting meaningful friendships, does it burn you out?

Little (but wordy) background: 
I’ve just recently turned 20 and I am about 3.5 hours into my flight lessons going towards a PPL. It started out as a joke honestly about flying with some friends but VERY quickly through further research, conversations, and taking my discovery flight (which happened to be my first logged lesson); I caught the “bug” everyone in aviation seems to relate too. In just that small amount of time I’ve been told over and over by my instructor I have a natural feeling for it and felt very over prepared for my first lesson (I promise I’m not trying to brag for upvotes, I’m just trying to explain my situation).
He told me he scrapped his whole “introductory” lesson plan he had for our first couple lessons and threw a couple of maneuvers at me right out the gate in the first hour just to see what would happen. We started with steep turns to a heading, climbs/descents to a heading, and 3 normal take-offs and landings which I caught on too very quickly/concerning-ly for the first hour and was able to do with little assistance after the first explanation. Long story short: me 20, 3.5 hour, want good approach/landing so me solo

I have a consistent problem when entering the pattern to land to where I always seem to either come in on final way too high, way too slow, or way too high and slow. When I am slow my airspeed is around 60 knots and sometimes drops to 55 which is way too close to stalling speed.

188,Anyone who owns a plane? Considering buying second hand for hour building,"So I'm set to start CPL training soon, and I've been tempted to look into owning my own aircraft as a way to reduce costs. As I'm doing my training out of Bankstown Airport in Sydney, I was wondering if any Aussies might be able to help me out here.

The organisation I'm training with charges me $450 dual and $350 rental for an Arrow, or $125 for just an instructor. This is their cheapest option that has both CSU and retract. In the last couple of months, I've been looking through classifieds, and though the first Arrow I set my sights on has since been sold, it gave me a baseline for what I'd expect. $55 000, for a 69 model with 9500 TTIS. Certainly looked better than the horribly abused aircraft a flight training organisation has!

Anyway, so I went to Bankstown Airport's website and downloaded their conditions of use document. Assuming I've interpreted it correctly, landing, parking and maintenance can be bundled into one fee, which is about $6000 per year, per 1000 MTOW. Given the Arrow is about 1200 MTOW, I'm not sure if the price scales linearly, or if they charge you the higher amount for even 1 Kg over 1000, but I'll assume the worst case and say its $12 000 a year.

Alright, so let's take our example aircraft and add the annual airport cost. $67 000. If I divide this by the dual and rental rates separately, I'll get 149 and 191 hours respectively. This means that I'd need to use the purchased aircraft for this many hours in one year before it ends up being cheaper than the school rates. About 3 to 4 hours per week over the course of one year. Costs over subsequent years would be lower once the purchase price is made back (or rather, from the difference between school and operating costs). For this many hours, fuel prices are negligible to me.

Here's where things start to break down for me. First, you might have noticed that I have not mentioned anything about insurance. That's because I have not been able to find any information about it in Australia. I get that it's circumstantial, but does anyone have a rough idea of what I'd expect to pay per year? Hundreds? Thousands? Tens of thousands? I'm going to assume it's in the range of thousands, but could anyone possibly narrow it down a little more?

Now since I haven't factored insurance in, this means that the numbers I mentioned above will be different. Annual operating costs would be higher, and I'd therefore need to use the aircraft more often to make it financially viable, but I doubt I'd need to fly the aircraft that much more than what I've already outlined. This brings me to my next thought: What if I rent it out when I don't need it?

I've heard different opinions, on this, but some people say I would need an AOC, while others say that I don't. From what I understand, an AOC is required when your aircraft is engaged in commercial operations, similar to a CPL being required for a pilot engaging in commercial operations. However, a PPL holder can take up to 5 others on an aircraft, split the costs of the flight, and still be legal, provided no profit was made. Does the same logic apply with an AOC? I'm not interested in making money off any aircraft I might purchase. I'd just want the costs to be covered, and that's it. Also, from what I understand, an AOC drives up insurance prices.

Now, if you've had the patience to read through all of this, kudos to you. Anything else that I might have neglected to take into account?",flying,1567837570,HiigaranTheFirst,14,1,True,2019-09-07

208,Aircraft Lighting - Check Ride Q&amp;A,"Sorry for the moronic, non-Monday student questions, but this is gnawing at (or is it on?) me.

Background/Context:

My aircraft has two lighting systems.  ""Strobe"" and ""navigation."" A toggle switch lets me select wing tip strobes on, off, or wing tips navigation lights on.  I cannot select both strobe and navigation - it is choice of one, the other, or off.  Except for a landing light that is operated by a separate on/off toggle switch, those are the only external lights on my small, single engine aircraft.

FAA Light Requirements for day VFR:

Per 91.205(11) (day vfr equip. req.): ""For small civil airplanes certificated after March 11, 1996, in accordance with part 23 of this chapter, an approved aviation red or aviation white anticollision light system. In the event of failure of any light of the anticollision light system, operation of the aircraft may continue to a location where repairs or replacement can be made.""

Relevant Definition:

The FAA defines my strobe lights as an ""anti collision"" light system, but my ""navigation"" lights are not an ""anti collision"" light system.

Application:

I am going to fly day VFR and during preflight I discover one or both sides of my strobe light(s) does/do not function, but my navigation lights function.  I cannot fly the aircraft because I do not have a functioning anti collision light system.  Additionally, I cannot fly somewhere to have the strobe system fixed because the ""in event of failure"" exception only applies for ""continu\[ing\] to a location"" when the failure occurs during ""operation.""

Why does my aircraft have an option to turn on navigation lights if they are not sufficient to fly?  A) if I flying when the strobes go out, at least I have the navigation lights for visibility; B) per the AIM, if taxiing (day or night) and the strobes may cause a safety hazard, I can turn on the nav lights and wait until takeoff before turning on the strobes; and C) above 10,000 ft, turn the strobes off and turn the nav lights on (not sure if required or an AIM recommendation).

Bottom line/Questions: 

1. If asked during a check ride whether I can fly without both strobe lights working if discovered one or both are nonfunctional on preflight I say no/never without exception.  
2. If told while airborne during a checkride that I just lost one or both my strobe lights and I am asked what would I do in response, I should say I would immediately return to my home airport where I know that repairs or replacement can be made (i.e., I do not have to land immediately at any location where repairs or replacement can be made even though 91.205(11) says anti collision lights are required for day VFR - the failure during operation exception applies to ""a location"" and does not require the closest location).
3. If asked during the oral portion of my check ride what would I do if my navigation lights are non-functional?  I would say it does not matter as long as I have functioning strobe lights.  It would only matter if operating strobes on the ground created a hazard and even then using nav lights instead of strobes is common sense risk management - not a mandatory requirement. Interesting side note - my preflight checklist includes checking the strobe function, but does not include checking the navigation lights/function.  I doubt I would ever know when my strobes worked but the nav function did not (maybe that is not possible - the strobe and nav functions share the same circuit breaker).

209,Changing CFIs near the finish line,"I’m about 38 hours into this flying thing. We’ve started XC flying, and the end of the syllabus is near, maybe five lesson left to complete, including check ride prep. 

My CFI and I have also had a few significant conflicts during our time together. Like shouting in the cockpit, need-to-debrief arguments. No life threatening situations, nothing where controls had to be wrestled away to avoid lawn darting, but a few serious, brief arguments that have since all been resolved. 

Today we discussed whether it’s best for us to part ways, and they left it in my court to decide, within parameters. 

CFI is successful - they’ve steered dozens and dozens of students to PPL and beyond. I know this CFI has genuine in his care for my flying, but I worry that the conflict will continue to detract from our time in the plane. 

The alternative is a newer CFI who I’ve flown with a handful of times. We seem to get along well and have personalities closer in line. This would mean re-soloing, and time getting to know my flying, etc. 

So it seems the choice is push through with a proven CFI with whom there’s been significant conflict, or try to shift to a new instructor who is less experienced but may be a better fit.

I'm looking for actual ages of the pilots and hiring data (age, where they came from for the national/major carriers, number of hours when hired at all airlines). Would really like historical data. 

u/PanAm11111111: buckle up buddy.

About a month ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/cmi8nh/random_stats_graphs_on_airline_pilots_age/). It was mindless thoughts on random graphs I made in excel because I was bored. However, useful stuff was posted and I'm gonna repost it here.

Some facts to keep in mind:

1. The maximum amount of nominal retirements don't happen until 2025.

2. The first peak is Delta's in 2022.

3. The last peak is in 2035, SWs. If you can't make it from zero to SW-ready in 16 years you've got issues. 


Some other stats that I didn't share:

Airlines will have over 49,925 mandatory retirements between now and 2052. Let's limit this to say, 2028-2038, a reasonable time period for you to start now and maybe make it to a major/good life-time carrier. Just at United, AA, Delta, Alaska, SW, Kallita, UPS, and FedEx, there will be 22,401 mandatory retirements. Obviously there will be more, if a 50yr old is hired today they have to retire in 2035, raising that number.


But let's do some more math. My data had 49,925 mandatory retirements listed. (Data was from APC). However, there are currently 63,741 pilots at those airlines. Hence, I only had 78.3248% of the data. Let's assume that the mandatory retirements are distributed randomly among the years (a fairly weak assumption, but one we must make to go further), that means there will actually be 28,600 retirements at those airlines in the time period of 2028-2038.

This is where we start to run into a problem. Well, it's not a problem for US, but it is certainly a problem for the airlines. 

According to the FAA airline statistics, there were 5,795 new ATP certificates issues last year. Assuming this stays constant (which, I believe to be a weak assumption. The growth rate of new commercial pilots is not coming close to the growth rate of new ATPs. Unless were are seeing a higher percentage of commercial pilots become ATPs, this means that the supply of ATPs will not grow quickly.) That means 57,950 new ATPs in any 10 year period. 

But wait, not every ATP is working at an airline. There are currently 162,145 ATPs. But the Bureau of Transportation statistics only had 87,004 ATPs working at airlines (airlines must report data if they operate at least one aircraft weighing 18,000 or above) 

So, only about 1/2 of ATPs are working for an airline. We can thus figure that about 1/2 of the new ATPs aren't working for an airline. (Actually more than will, but they will be off-set by early retirements. In the end, we will only see an increase in ATPs by 1/2 of the new ATP rate. We can confirm this by looking at historical airline size, hiring, mandatory retirements, and new ATP certificates issued numbers. I did confirm this, but I think I have enough numbers in this post already). At the end of the day, this means we will only see net ~28,975 entering the workforce in a 10 year period, not including mandatory retirements.

So let's estimate how many total mandatory retirements there will be between 2028-2038. That number (calculated by assuming all working ATPs have the same retirement distribution at my previously mentioned selected airlines) is 31,067.

So we have 28,975 new ATPs (net of early retirements, ATPs not working for an airline, etc) and will have 31,067. Some basic math tells you that that means there will be a deficit of pilots.

But wait, there's more!

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics broke the numbers down by airlines. At Endevear, Compass, ExpressJet, GoJet, Envoy, PSA, Skywest, Mesa, and Republic there are 15,663. Let's assume that of the ""majors"" I listed, 75% of the hiring is coming from those regionals. If we assume that 100% of the pilots from those regionals will go to one of my ""majors"", then that means the regionals will be completely depleted by 2026. 

So that means that:

1. The hiring boom has yet to reach it's maximum

2. The flows will continue to shorten to major airlines before the boom even occurs.

3. There are not enough pilots being created to support the hiring boom coming.

3. Due to the above 3, the demand for labor will continue to climb even after the mandatory retirements reaches the maximum, far into the future.


Now, let's go to u/PanAm11111111's original post and break it down. 

&gt;Had you asked whether it was a good idea to become a pilot or not in the midst of the 2009 recession, everyone on reddit would have said NO. Yet, those who started their training in 2008-2009 are now at majors and legacies, for the most part. Anyone who took that advice lost out BIG TIME.

Actually, the advice would probably have been now is a great time to start training. The ones that entered training right a few years before the **great** recession got fucked though. 

&gt;WRONG. Anyone starting today will pay the most amount in the history of aviation to get their ratings, have their training delayed by MONTHS due to instructor and DPE shortages, possibly make it to a regional ... and be on the street in 2021.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time to plant one is today. Sure, it will take longer to get through training right now than 5 years ago. But given the increased demand for pilots (and presumably no increase in DPE supply), you will have a shorter wait today than in 5 years. Also, even if training time is shorter in 5 years, you are giving up 5 years of major airline pay, which would be a [very stupid decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/clsglp/what_is_6_months_truly_wortha_cost_analysis/)

&gt;Do not listen to financial advice from pilots. 

I dunno about that. I'd invest in Beenie Babies if I were you.

Seriously though, ""enter the airlines"" is not financial advice. I am not telling you what to invest in. I'm saying, ""look at the numbers, we need more pilots and also delaying being a pilot is expensive as fuck""

&gt;Anyone starting today will NOT benefit from the ""boom"". The peak is NOT THE RIGHT TIME to enter the market.

No. Yes. 

The peak is not right now. The peak is in 7+ years from now. Even after the peak, the demand for pilots will be high. 

&gt;Do not expect the greatest growth in the history of the US economy to continue for more than another year or two.

I find it interesting that you used the 2009 recession earlier to prove your point, but you are now trying to make the point that this is the *greatest* growth in the US economy? I mean, we should acknowledge that this expansion is probably overheating and it's gonna go down soon, but we should also acknowledge that the 2009 recession was rare. The 2009 recession say a 5.1% GDP decline. The 2001 recession was 0.3%. 1990 was 1.4%. 1981 was 2.7%. 1980 was 2.2%. 1973 was 3.2%. 1970 was 0.6%. If you read an economics textbook (I recommend Robert Gordon's Macroeconomics), the 2009 recession also had an unusually long recovery. Yes, a recession is looming. But there is a high likelihood that the recession will not be like 2009 in duration or intensity. (In fact, many economists would argue that the next recession will be a longer and very shallow slide. Perhaps even positive GDP growth, but below the natural rate.)

Beyond that, do you know the best place to be in a recession? In training. You don't have to worry about losing your job if you aren't working. Stuff gets cheaper.

232,Owning small plane + co-owning larger plane for different missions?,"Hello /r/flying,

New student pilot, long time lurker, first time poster here from Massachusetts. I searched aggressively on this topic, found a lot of ""buy your second plane first"", but my situation has some nuance to it, and I'd love your advice.

I would like to purchase a small aircraft\[1\] for my training, for all the usual reasons\[2\]. I am weighing the common advice to buy my second plane first, but it's tricky because there are so many different missions I'm excited about. My best guess at what my breakdown will look like after getting my PPL is:

1. 55% quick solo runs to the cape, vineyard, visiting my parents in NY.
2. 15% day trips with my wife or a friend, similar to above.
3. 15% week/weekend trips with my wife and our two beagles (combined human/dog weight: 395 lbs)
4. 10% day trips with my wife and another couple.
5. 5% week/weekend trips with my wife and another couple

\#5 is frustrating me because it's an infrequent edge case, and yet it's the one situation where renting and clubs aren't feasible (daily min hours). I'm not sure what to do about this -- buying a plane of that class is obviously overkill for 85% of my flying, and it would make my training massively more expensive (maintenance, fuel burn, insurance, not to mention upfront cost).

The two most sensible paths forward that I see are:

1. Buy a 150 for training, which will do missions 1-2 long term. Keep it and buy a 1/6-ish share of a 182R or 210 to cover missions 3-5.
2. Buy a 172 for training. Sell it after to buy a 182R or 210 outright.

My instinct is that #1 would be more economical and less hassle (no need to re-sell the plane) than #2. A 150 would do 70% of my missions at less than half the operating cost. And because I'd have access to a bigger plane, I could do a leaseback to recoup some money and still be able to fly when it's down for mx or repairs.

Questions:

1. If I have access to a larger plane, will I still want to take the 150 on solo or short two-person trips? I think I will but I'd like a sanity check, as I haven't been in one yet (working on it -- school does not have one). I know they're tight (I'm 6', 160 lbs).
2. I could also do a variant of #1 but get a 172 instead of a 150. My instinct is there's too much overlap to own a 172 and share a 182R or 210. But am I overthinking that? Does it in fact make sense for my situation?
3. In your eyes, is there a clear winner among these options?
4. Am I correct that buying/co-buying is the only good answer for doing week-long trips? I've looked at rentals and clubs, but the minimum hour rules I've seen make it prohibitively expensive.
5. Any other advice, or things I should consider that I haven't already?

Many thanks in advance!

Notes:

\[1\] I'm referencing Cessnas because I'm most familiar with their models, but I'm open to Pipers and other class equivalents. I'm mostly interested in the high level question about single vs multiple planes for different missions.

\[2\] My reasons for wanting to buy a training aircraft are: cost savings (my first 2 years' hours will put me way past the break-even point vs renting), securing access to an instrument-rated aircraft (I expect to get my IFR, and my school only has one), minimal schedule restrictions when soloing). If I'm going to spend more than I absolutely have to on flying, I'd rather it be on continuing education (extra CFI hours) than rental overhead.",flying,1567967442,freerobby,37,6,True,2019-09-08
235,Clarifying FAR 91.17 (alcohol),"Hi! Newly minted PPL with a question about regulations. I flew a non-pilot friend on a short X/C for lunch, and he had a beer. On the way back, he reminded me that I offered he try out the flight controls, but I decided not to give him the controls since he had had alcohol recently.

I plan to maintain an 8 hour ""bottle to throttle"" limit for all persons onboard any aircraft where I operate as PIC. However, I wonder whether letting him do some basic maneuvers (straight &amp; level, climbs, descents, 10 degree turns) would have been legal. Regulations aside, I think it would have been fairly safe.

My interpretation of the FARs is ""no, it would have been illegal"" but I'd like to hear some expert opinions. I reason that my designating he take the controls while I operate radios, scan for traffic, etc. would constitute being assigned duties by me, the PIC.

The law reproduced below for reference:

&gt;91.17 Alcohol or drugs.

&gt;(a) No person may act or attempt to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft -

242,C172 Intermittent Oil Pressure Warning,"Hi All, low-time pilot here (60 Hrs),  
This weekend I took a buddy up to do some sightseeing and enjoy that post-hurricane weather in the FBO's glass cockpit C172. About 20-30 minutes into the flight we're at cruise and I hear a ding as a red OIL PRESSURE warning pops up on the MFD. It lasted maybe two/three seconds and went away, the gauge itself was right on the low edge of the green arc but seemed steady. There was no other indication of trouble.

About 2 minutes later the warning reappeared for a few seconds and then extinguished and I made the decision to turn around and head back to the airport. This was my first time in a glass cockpit aside from 2 hours transition training and I wasn't comfortable not understanding what was happening with the engine.

I headed back to base, picking out fields the whole time and going over the off-airport landing checklist in my head, but made it back without incident. The warning appeared probably another 10 times on the way back, only ever lasting for a few seconds each time. I wrote up a squawk and told the FBO what had happened when I returned and one of the instructors overheard me and said ""Oh yeah it was doing that yesterday to me too, did you check the gauge? Probably a sensor glitch"" and made it seem like it really wasn't a big deal at all.

Did I overreact in aborting the flight? This was my first time ever seeing a warning like that though admittedly all my training was on steam gauges. Is this a thing that just happens? I figured the whole system uses the same sensors so a warning is a warning and it definitely felt like a potentially hazardous situation and maybe I've been watching too many of those air safety videos but they always have a section that's like ""if only he'd listened to the warning he'd still be alive today.""",flying,1567981414,AYellowDart,10,8,True,2019-09-08

267,Questions regarding obtaining a Sports Pilot License.,"Howdy Aviators! 

I’m interested in obtaining my Sports Pilot License (eventually private and instrumental as well). I have zero experience or knowledge when it comes to flying, but it has always been a dream and passion of mine (maybe even a job/career?). 

I’m 24 years old and live in NYC. I have no idea where to start and need your guidance / recommendations. 

I see articles how one can get their SPL for about $5000, but I’m not sure how accurate this is. 

Also, is there any online websites or resources I can use to help study for this? Any certificates (saw something about FAA Medical) I can get ahead of time online, or things I can do to set myself ahead before I even start? 

Also, what certification process must I go through in order to be able to operate jet planes? 

Thank you all in advance.

273,"Failed IR Oral Write-up, read this so you aren't me.","Very standard for the most part, I'm going to give a very general overview and then go in depth into what I missed. 

Super normal stuff:

\-Pilot qualifications, currency for carrying passengers, currency related to IFR, and currency in general (don't forget about flight review every 24 months).

\-Flight plan why I chose the route that I did altitudes, weather, (what kind of turbulence is in an airmet tango: light to moderate, surface wind up to 30 knots, wind shear).

\-What is an MEA and what does it guarantee? (Navigational reception and obstacle clearance). 

\-What kinds of VORs are there along the route (system volume).  How do VORs work? (Two radio waves, one pulsing in all directions, the other rotating 1800rpm and the difference in the radio waves from your position is shown as radials).  

\-Can you just file just the victor airway even if it changes direction at certain waypoints? (Yes). 

\-Alternates and weather minimums for said alternates (1-2-3 rule).

\-Minor thing that got me: where do the different GPS modes start? En-route, terminal, and approach.  How far from the airport in NM does it cycle to the next. I knew the accuracy of each mode though.

Where I fucked up: I had one thing I missed that caused me to fail. On my schools IFR flight plan sheets, there is not a column for fuel in GALLONS, only fuel in TIME.  Since IFRs fuel requirements are all time based I didn't give it much thought (to destination, to alternate if required, +45min) but to him it was unacceptable.  I calculated the fuel in gallons in under 30 seconds in front of him to show that I am capable:

8 gal/hr being very safe and were estimated 142 minutes enroute.  8/60\*142=18.933... call it 20 gallons + whatever fuel I used to get to my TOC which was around 4 gallons so 24 total, we have 53 useable so not even half tanks. He said I needed it written down on the flightplan. It was on my foreflight flight plan but I forgot to mention that to him but I doubt that would keep me afloat. So boom I failed right around an hour in.  

I continue and I missed one other thing after that: He went very in depth on the ILS and I told him about the two different frequencies 90hz 150hz and how where the overlap is where it will give you the indications. He asked me how far the localizer and glide slope stick out and wanted an answer in NM, how wide they are in degrees and NM, where the glideslope is on the runway and the distance from the approach end of the runway in feet (I said 1/4 - 1/3 down the runway on the approach side and that wasn't good enough).  He also wanted to know how far the marker beacons are in NM on the approach and I did not know the answer.

That's it! I hopefully retake it soon and were only gonna go over the fuel part and bits of the ILS. 

**TLDR: Write down the fuel in gallons on your flight plan, this DPE really quizzes a lot on navigational instruments and how they work so know VORs, GPS, and ILS inside and out.  He did not mention WAAS.  Also, as of 8/27 the FAA is requiring you to use** [ICAO flight plan sheets](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2019/august/06/mandatory-icao-flight-plan-filing-back-on-track)**, so use one and this probably won't happen to you.

274,PA28-181 Suspicious Ammeter and Voltmeter Behavior,"Hi everyone, fresh first time owners of a PA28-181 here looking for thoughts on a possible electrical/alternator problem. We have conflicting information and we're not quite sure how to proceed, maybe an A&amp;P here or someone with good knowledge of electrical systems could help us.

After a flight a week ago with my husband (newly-minted pilot), he noticed the ammeter in this Archer does not go down to 0. During run-up and flight though it looked like the ammeter was showing it's usual readings (around 35 is where it usually sits). During a flight last Saturday however I looked over at the ammeter and was surprised to see the needle past 70. My husband turned the ALT switch off and back on, and it reacted like you'd expect. The needle dropped to this particular ammeter's ""0"" when off and back to 35 when turned back on. Having already had an emergency landing due to an alternator melting itself during a training flight in another plane, we played it safe and landed the plane and did some research that night.

Sunday morning we got in the plane and during runup we tested the alternator and battery. *Most* of the time the ammeter would drop down to it's ""0"" when you turned off the alternator and then go back up to around 35 when back on. One time I saw it drop back down to below 20 or so on its own, and when the ALT switch was turned off and on again it did not budge from ""0"". After one more attempt it did return to 35. We flew in the pattern for a few touch-and-gos and the ammeter looked to be performing normally.

That evening we got hold of a cigarette lighter voltmeter and put it in the plane to see how it would read during a runup. I wish I took a video of this test to have exact data to give but right now I don't. I remember the battery started up showing about 12.5V from the cigarette lighter and slowly falling. Once the engine was started it jumped to around 13.5-13.8V which from the research done the night before seemed to be the correct range. With the RPM being increased to \~1900 though for the runup the voltmeter was showing 14.5V. We would have taken the plane out to do some pattern work and watch to see what it does but unfortunately it was already dark and it seems the landing light had burnt out between the morning and when we were performing this test.

Judging from the voltmeter reading and from the information we found on aviation forums, it looked unanimously agreed upon that anything over 14V is too high and could damage electrical components over time as well as the battery. However the A&amp;P of my husband's flight school whom he talked to this morning said 14.5V is perfect and that's what most of their planes (Warriors) run at. Information about alternators in general (not aviation specific) said a 14V alternator can produce 14.5V and it's not a big deal. Personally, my faith in this A&amp;P is a little on the fence considering, without giving too much information here, the flight school's planes have had a recent history of recurrent alternator problems... but maybe I'm just paranoid.

So my question is, what is the right answer here? Is 14.5V an overcharge that should be investigated (faulty regulator or some other problem)? Clearly our ammeter is at least somewhat faulty without dropping back down to the actual 0 on it, perhaps the jump to over 70 amps was a fluke of the ammeter and had nothing to do with the alternator or anything else. I'd like to get more data on this, what kind of test can we do to have a better idea of what's going on so we can give an A&amp;P more detail about where to look? If this were your plane/a plane in your shop what would you do?

TL;DR: Is 14.5V on a cigarette lighter voltmeter during runup cause for concern about faulty alternator/regulator/electrical stuff? Our ammeter might be lying and we don't want an electrical fire/exploded battery.",flying,1568047201,_amaitae_,5,4,True,2019-09-09

276,Wingtip vortices when the plane is not flying,"Hello all,

I have a question regarding wake turbulence. As you know, in general the guidelines are to take off at a point before the wake turbulence generating aircraft and land at a point after the plane ahead. My question is regarding any point at which a plane is rolling down the runway at high speed but not enough to actually fly, say a 777 in it's take-off roll at 140 knots.

At that speed, wouldn't lift be generated, just not enough to counteract the mass of the plane? If so, wouldn't wingtip vortices be formed? So hypothetically, if I'm taking off in a 172, 30 seconds after a 777 (I know that we have our two minutes) would it be possible to encounter wake turbulence even before the 777's rotation point, excluding wind effects?

**TL/DR: Are wingtip vortices only formed when the plane is in the air or also when rolling down the runway at high speed?**

284,Crankshaft tale of woe. Who's to blame?,"\[ throwaway because FAA \]

Bought an aircraft in 2014. Hired a maintenance service to handle coordinating the prebuy and managing MX. The airplane got a clean bill of health from them (meaning that there were a few squawks but no major or expensive issues). Same at the first two annuals, which were done by a reputable shop that they recommended. 

Just got ready to sell the plane and spotted a problem: [Lycoming MSB 569A](https://www.lycoming.com/content/service-bulletin-no-569a) was not complied with. The engine was factory overhauled in 2000. There are no log entries from 2000 forward showing that the non-compliant crank installed by the factory was ever replaced. Now the plane's unairworthy until the crankshaft is replaced. Oddly, the buyer doesn't want it any more, go figure.

The FAA originally put out AD 2006-20-09 and it was later replaced with AD 2012-19-01. The AD requires crank replacement the next time the crankcase is split but in no case later than 12 years after the engine first went into service. In my case, that's 2012, but we didn't buy the plane until 2014 so it should have been done before then.

Now, here's what I'm wondering. I have a series of AD compliance reports from the shops that have done the annuals since I bought the plane. So there's a paper trail dating back to 2006 where shops are saying all the relevant ADs have been complied with, and yet I have the wrong crank in the plane and it's got to be replaced.

My question: who's liable for this? I wouldn't have bought the airplane in an unairworthy condition if I had known. Possible answers include:

* Me alone. *Caveat emptor*, sucker.
* The maintenance management company. They didn't spot the problem during the prebuy or either of the first two annuals. 
* The shop that did my first two annuals
* The shop(s) that did later annuals
* Lycoming
* My ex-wife (what the hell, lots of other stuff is her fault so why not put her here)

More practically I am wondering if I have any recourse, other than paying out of pocket to replace the ""bad"" crank, given that my beloved plane is now both unsellable and unflyable.

My theory is that all of the shops will point to the shop before them and say ""oh, I looked at the previous history in the logs and used that as the basis of determining compliance"" but I'd like to know if that's a valid defense or not.",flying,1568053634,damnYouLycoming,31,30,True,2019-09-09

306,"Call the tower.. without ""possible pilot deviation""?","For context, I fly twin turboprops and jets in the midwest..

Today I was given clearance to land on a runway that I thought I was on downwind for, but turned out I was cleared to land on the intersecting runway. I noticed this just as I was passing through final on the correct runway, realized what I was doing, and started a right hand turn back to final. I was given instruction from the controller to do a left 360 because there was traffic in the downwind heading towards me. I saw the traffic, and from my viewpoint, he was at my 11 o'clock and doing a left turn would have put me in a TA/RA conflict with the guy. I reintercepted the final for the correct runway about a mile out, and continued to land the aircraft. I had no TA/RA conflicts, no bank in excess of 25 degrees, and no evasive action on either airplane. My clearance to land was never cancelled. I taxi'd in and the tower controller told me to give them a call and that the FBO I was going to has the tower number. The words ""possible pilot deviation"" were never spoken.

I called and got a bit of a slap on the wrist, but the back and fourth between the controller and I seemed fine. I made a mistake, and owned up to it. The controller mentioned that it was ""no harm, no foul"" but that ""this shouldn't happen again"". My name, certificate number, or phone number was never taken down. I filed a NASA report.

309,Departing from within a sports-TFR....no one cares.,"So apparently, no one gives a shit. I did my best to pick up flight following, never got it, and no one cared in the slightest.

I flew in for the opening Browns game (yeah, don't need to hear it, fucking disaster).

We left after the game and fought 17 private jets for priority for takeoff (Cessna 172 here).... None of this happened during the 0-16 season, it was easy departure all the way back then.

Anyway, tried to pick up Flight Following on the ground. Knew it wouldn't happen because I've been there before and they always just tell you to pick it up from Cleveland departure. On a day like this, I was hoping, but no luck. Not sure of the rules for departing VFR in a TFR with no independent squawk code but ATC told me to pick it up from departure in the air, so what are they gonna do? Yell at me?

So I depart off 6, turn south. Call Cleveland departure a few times... only response ""Cessna calling, standby"".... lol never got a return call for 20 minutes getting out from under the Bravo. No big deal, they were super busy. I was just trying to follow the rules. I figured I'd put myself on tape twice asking for FF, so I was clear for TFR purposes.

So the conclusion I have is that in Cleveland, no one cares about sports TFRs if everyone is busy.

Maybe it's different everywhere else. I tried to follow the rules, I gave up after the standby. No one cared.

Awesome. In the air, America is still free!

I was wondering if it would be a good start to becoming a commercial pilot or would I be better off going to a school like Southern Utah University (SUU)? From everything I have seen online, at CSN I would earn an Associates Degree in Aviation Tech along with my Private Pilots License, Commercial Pilots Certificate and FAA Instrument Rating. I currently live in Vegas and go to UNLV so the Transition would be pretty easy I believe.

Meanwhile at SUU (Cedar City, Utah) I could earn a Bachelors Degree in Aviation Science and complete all the same FAA Requirements such as Privates Pilot, Instrument Rating, Commercial Pilots and CFI on top of the other three. They also have a Fixed Wing Program that works with SkyWest and would allow qualified student to complete their training and become a SkyWest Pilot and have some tuition reimbursement . At least this is how I am interpreting it.

As I said previously I am currently going to school at UNLV. I wouldn't mind the transition to either school as one is where I currently live and the other is a place I really like visiting. The only issue I may have with SUU is the cost, as I would be paying out of state tuition and would basically be on my own to pay for my housing and such. I have also thought about going to CSN for 2 years then transferring to SUU for my final 2 years to earn a bachelors degree, but I am not sure if this would be 1.) Viable to transfer credits, and 2.) A smart decision to even try since i will have already completed my Private Pilots, Instrument Rating and Commercial Pilots Certificate.

That being said I was wondering if there is anyone who has gone through either of the programs or is currently going through either of the programs and would like to share any information on either of them.

Previously if I filed as a C-172-G, that was all I needed. She said that If I only filed as -G, they would assume I had no radios or any other equipment other than WAAS enabled GPS.

**Subtitle:** How NOT to get your PPL!

Whoop, whoop, passed my PPL checkride today. It has been 48 years and 5 days from when I took my first flight. Let’s see if anyone can beat that??!! Someone called and said I won a procrastination trophy and I told them I would pick it up next week. 

Back when I was 18, I was in Civil Air Patrol and was awarded a flight scholarship that paid for my flight lessons through solo. I soloed at 7.9 hours and had 9.2 hours total. Then I ran out of money. My family was not wealthy and I didn’t know anything about how to become a commercial pilot and my eyesight was not good enough to become a USAF pilot. (And as I always have to remind my kids, no, Orville was not my first flight instructor! (It was Wilbur)) Well back in my day we had to taxi 10 NM through snow, uphill both ways, just to get to flight school!

I have had a bucket list item to complete that certificate and last year I started taking flight lessons after finding my old logbook and receiving some encouragement from my wife. This time around, I soloed (again) at 12 hours and had 72 hours this morning before my checkride (including the 9.4 hours from 1971.)  Note: I would NOT suggest this is the way to get your PPL!

I just wish there was Reddit and YouTube back in the day that would have been a place to research flying jobs and receive encouragement.

I also started a business around the same time and had to pick \*this\* or \*that.\* I went with the business and 8 years later am considering my aviation career again. I currently build custom machinery for food-production plants and while I enjoy it, the complication of (hard driving personality) customers, high liability, and boom-or-bust nature of the business has me wondering...

...**is my aviation career ""scarred"" by an 8 year break**? In the early 2000's I remember lots of stories of how airlines &amp; employers will judge your commitment/passion for aviation... taking into account time away from flight. 

Aside from instruction, what would you consider a ""gettable"" foot-back-in-the-door-job? We live in Colorado - moving to chase the gigs might be tough with a 2year old and a wife's career these days.

I certainly have some currency to get back to first - maybe getting my II ride, safety procedures re-crisped, etc...

I realize aviation has it's cultural complications and there are a lot of unhappy pilots these days. But I do miss the single-minded mission --- get there safely --- vs juggling this wild beast of a business.

I'm a bit bummed by the Right-seat-ATP requirements that came into action while I was gone... So I'd have another 1000 hours to acquire before an airline slot is an option. I do have a few income streams I could probably keep alive while flying for lesser pay, feeding the kid, etc...

*can fly in the daytime with broken lights? placard and render inop, squawk log. Over 100hr? Broken fuel gauge -- I said yes with a ferry permit, he said -- nice! but what about normal operations, how to get ferry permit?

*Does your plane have MEL? no, 91.205

*What do you expect at 3C / 3 dew point? fog

*If you have frost, can you fly? what to do? I answered hot air blower, then bucket of hot water. Asked about cold weather starting procedure

*what is hypoxia?

*hypothetical: 2C on the surface, visible moisture. What might happen? What anti-icing equipment do you have? Answer: pitot heat, carb heat, POH specifies no flight into known icing

*each airspace, takeoff requirements. class Delta minimum -- I answered 1 mi CoC, then he prompted ""normal operations"", and I said 3 mi, 1000 ceiling

*Approach towards SF, Norcal says fly south, squawk XXXX, what do you do? Do not enter, not cleared for Bravo

*Class G, E, D, minimums

*Rotating beacon during daytime, what does it mean? Correctly answered IFR, he wanted details (&lt;1000 ft ceilings or &lt;3 mi visibility or both)

*Sectional -- marking for fuel, beacon, elevation, has tower/no tower, CTAF, etc.

*Sectional -- (R) what does it mean, MOA, who do you need to talk to?

*in-flight weather -- ask FSS, find a VOR with FSS, ATIS

*takeoff distance and landing distance at TRK -- use current altimeter, wind and temp

*Asked about engine O-230, oil amount (opposed cylinder, 230 inch displacement)

*Vx, Vy, Va. The definitions he wants to hear are: Vx = most altitude gain per ground distance. Vy = most altitude gain per time.

**Cross Country**

*asked about weather en route, winds.

*why I didn't go direct -- can't climb fast enough to respect Mather pattern altitude, so just clip through mather and ask for transition

*why choose altitude? Not just ""odd/even + 500"", but if you can choose 4500, 6500 or 8500, why pick the one you picked?

*fuel planning -- VFR fuel minimums, then hypothetical diversion, legal? Yes, because it was planned with 1/2 hr of fuel

*Asked about each of the radios, oil cooler, shimmy dampener
did W+B, he claimed to be 200lb, and during w+b, we found we were overweight even after runup, so we left our bags at the FBO

*VOR DEAD?! I GOT LOST

*good pilotage to Mustang airport. I was very confident and declared: We are at Mustang now by our airspeed and by the clock, so I will make left 360 to find Mustang. Turned out it was under right wheel

*Navigation near Sac was really hard for me because there are no landmarks. I studied google maps of the area from MCC to Mustang to memorize the area. Noted railroad tracks, roads, canals.

*Navigate to Franklin and land as I see fit. Good preparation paid off here because it is impossible to find by landmarks, but I pre-measured distances, times and headings

*2 others in the pattern at Franklin. I remembered AWOS from MCC was 050, so I picked 090. 3 wind socks said 3 different directions

*Even though we were descending from 5500 to surface, I asked him if he'd like me to use an emergency descent. He responded negative.

*Set up a good approach, forward slip from being high, he called Go Around

*Second landing was short field. On final at 54kt, too high. Fwd slip to the ground, landed halfway down the runway, worse than the initial approach, and **FORGOT TO GO TO FULL STOP** I would have failed me here

*Turn around a point at 1000 ft, 90kt, water tower

*hood work, climbing turn

*Slow flight, down to 50kt. This I had some trouble with in practice, so I took my time to set up slowly, then stabilize, then trim. That way, slow flight went very smooth.

*Steep turns. I made motions to do clearing turns, then he rejected them. My max deviation was 20 ft.

* Takeoff stall straight ahead

* Configure for landing, start descent, approach to landing stall, straight ahead no turns

* Simulated emergency was over dirt strip at 2300 feet. Couldn't make 360 to high key, so extended upwind to turn downwind at 1600. I noted that in a real emergency, it's better to be a bit high than a bit low. He called Go Around on base.

*pretended to track VOR. **VOR WAS BROKEN** explained what I would do if it had worked

*Returned to MCC. 4 people all wanted to land at MCC, we sequenced ourselves. Since I was coming in on downwind for MCC and someone else claimed a 45 entry midfield into downwind, we talked until everyone knew where each other was.

*Soft field landing at MCC

**Overall**

*I think he liked the confidence of my work. I could state very authoritatively: Mustang is here. Even though I don't see it now, I can circle to find it. We are high, forward slip to landing.

*I think he liked my persistence. I thought the failure to stop during the short field landing was devastating, we kept going as if it was fine.

*Depth of knowledge on the oral I think was favorable. He was pleased that I mentioned one of the effects of icing might be airspeed or altitude gauge malfunction.

*I confused him, in a good way -- he looked at my sectional and couldn't figure out where we were. After 10 seconds, he realized I taped two sectionals together to make one continuous page. Thank goodness -- Franklin is RIGHT AT the fold, and you'd have to flip back and forth between the two sides.

*Even if you can't fly it, at least walk through your first checkpoint on the cross country on google maps. If you pick a high enough cruise altitude (5500 ft), what you see is almost the same as on google maps. If you pick a low cruise (3500), you might not see all the landmarks you need. Know the route cold. Know what things look like if you divert or some tower tells you to turn a heading.",flying,1568183177,arbitrageME,9,12,True,2019-09-11
355,Visceral night landing at YTZ with crazy wind shear (Volume Up!).,"I was invited by a friend to fly right seat on a long distance cross-country flight to build hours for his CPL. Being a low-hour private pilot I jumped at the chance to gain some experience helping to navigate and work the radio, and especially since we’d be arriving at night back in Toronto – something I hadn’t experienced as a pilot yet. We headed out from Toronto City Centre YTZ after work and had a beautiful smooth flight all the way to Chatham-Kent YCK. On the way back super smooth too... until about 5nm from the field under 2000’. At that point we started to get thrown around, a lot. Tower was reporting variable crosswinds with strong gusts. As we got down to circuit altitude the throws were more violent. I knew it was going to be a challenge for a seasoned pilot, let alone a couple of pilots with a total of 250 hours between them. The controller cleared us to land but told us to keep the speed up as we were being sandwiched between two Q400s also on approach to land. So now we had wake turbulence to consider too. My eyes were stuck to the airspeed dial. My friend peeled them off the glass, turned to me and said “don’t worry man, I got this”. I didn’t know if he was convincing himself, or me, or both of us. As we swooped down over the threshold there was a point where I thought we might hit the ground. Within a tense moment all wheels where back on the earth. He got us on the ground safely, but not before a few strong gusts tried pushing off the runway. Now safely taxiing to the hanger I started to laugh out loud. I laugh when I’m nervous.

I'm almost certain my low-hour-y-ness is showing here. These kind of landings are nothing new to commercial pilots but it was exciting to me and I thought I'd share. Anyone else have a memorable nervous landing to share?

For those interested I filmed the whole trip, which I'll be making into an episode for my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYyop62mW9svCRCjfvS_I4w). For now though, enjoy the landing! Wait for the gust at the end.",flying,1568200151,brettgunheart,0,1,True,2019-09-11

357,Advise for an aspiring UK airline pilot?,"TL;DR: ATPL is expensive and i don't know what to do next.

So a bit of circumstance first:

I'm 23, living in the UK, and just been rejected by the RAF to become a pilot due to 1 missing A level grade, they've offered to do an AST to see if Id be fit as either a mechanic or drone operator, however I'm feeling stuck at the minute, the way i see it is I have these choices to become a pilot;

1. join the RAF as a mechanic/drone operator and attempt to earn enough to pay for my PPL and CPL and just live out my 12 years of service, flying in my spare time and eventually becoming an instructor after my service.
2. retake my A level as quickly as possible and hope they'll still be looking for pilots in a years time and hope they'll accept me at 25, if not do no. 1
3. join the army as an Apache pilot before i turn 28 and hope airlines will accept heli hours after my service.
4. KLM are offering an apprenticeship as an aircraft mechanic, however my pay would only be \~£7000/year for the first year potentially leaving me in debt with living costs but after three years could save and try and get my foot in the door at KLM
5. go back to college and do a level 3 diploma in aeronautical engineering and hope I can get a job as an airline mechanic after that and earn enough to pay off an ATPL
6. approach a bank to get a loan which I'm pretty sure they'll reject immediately as i have no property to put it against
7. try and move to a different country and see if its cheaper or if i can get a loan there.

so I'm kind of stuck, how did you airline pilots even afford it? and is there any ideas I've neglected to think about or which of these options is most likely to end up with me flying as a career? and if you are an airline pilot how old were you when you got your ATPL?",flying,1568202006,Saiko-,11,3,True,2019-09-11

366,Canada Ultralight Permit Passed! w/ Costs,"I took a fairly unusual route to getting in the air (and will likely continue down an unusual route). I wanted to get in the air for some putzing around and $100 hamburgers. Did my research, and decided that Ultralights were pretty cool and mostly enough aeroplane for me. 


I found a school in my area that gave instruction in Ultralights for a good rate, $120 wet dual, $60 solo, or $60 instructor only. The school was just over an hour away from me which wasn't ideal but they're basically the only ultralight shop in town. I also did my ground school through Harv Air/pilottraining.ca. Unfortunately I started it once, life got in the way, and I had to rebuy the subscription so my costs are a touch inflated there. 


Training took place over this last summer mostly, I aimed to be in the air 2-3x a week when possible. Used early mornings before work and late evenings after to find cooler air as well. Had a decent number of cancellations from weather and instructor availability but got through it.


The other unusual thing I did was part way through my training I purchased an ultralight. I had been thinking about one in the back of my head and one came up at the right price at the right time and I jumped. My instructor told me that set me back probably 3-5 hours as I had to change type. I still ended up getting my permit in 20.6hrs, a bit below the average. Minimum time is 15hrs for an ultralight permit. I soloed at 15 hrs (again the type change messed me up a bit - probably would have been closer to 10 without the change). 


The original aeroplane I rented was a taildragger bushmaster, was extremely easy to fly. I ended up buying a Quad City Challenger II at 7.9hrs which set me back in my training a bit but I got to train in the plane I will fly which is nice. The school did not charge me for solo or ground time. I was obviously responsible for the costs of my own aeroplane when being instructed in it. I estimate that to be approximately $35/hr when fuel (premium mogas) and maintenance are added.

As mentioned, I purchased a Quad City Challenger II long wing with Rotax 503. I got it for a decent price and now have a plane I get to fly after completing my training (the rental market for ultralights in Canada is basically non-existent). It doesn't have a transponder but I can fly under and around the majority of airspace that requires it in my area. This is an advanced ultralight, so with the right endorsement or permit/license passengers may be carried.

There were some other minor expenses like buying tools and what not to mess around with the plane but those are things I needed anyways and will now have forever so I didn't count those. I have booked a discovery flight with a local certified aeroplane school for next week so I can start working towards a recreational pilot permit. I know that a lot of people don't like those permits, but here in Canada all my experience in ultralights counts towards the RPP but not the PPL. The Ultralight also cannot be used at night or IMC so I have no interest at this time of working towards those ratings. A RPP would allow me to carry passengers, and the FAA has a special flight authority agreement that would allow me to fly across the border with it as well. A regular Passenger Carrying Endorsement (PCE) for the UPP does not allow this.

It gave me hope that I too could overcome the obstacles and earn the private pilot rating. Today I can proudly say I did just that. One lifelong dream accomplished. The adrenaline still refuses to ebb off, and I'm not entirely sure I'll ever stop shaking. Since so many of you gave me hope when I felt down and out, here's my story (and a checkride write-up) for anyone out there who feels like they'll never get it done:

&amp;#x200B;

**Story/Background Information:**

I took an interest in aviation as a teenager, and was even gifted a discovery flight on my 17th birthday. Of course, like any good teenager, I realized that flying required effort, so I quickly put that discovery flight voucher away in a safe spot and promptly forgot about it. To this day I still regret not using that voucher. If I knew then what I know now about my love for this hobby, my world would be entirely different. 

Fast forward 13 years. New career, loving wife, and family. I transferred positions at my company to be closer to home. Inadvertently I also ended up being closer to an airport. A lot closer... Like close enough to read the tail numbers on takeoff and final approach outside the office window. Everyone in my building hated the planes (They still do!). I found them fascinating. So I went down to the airport to take that long overdue discovery flight on 3/31/18. My wallet says that was a mistake. I disagree. 

The first few lessons were uneventful, though a ton of fun. After about 3 hours my CFI told me to get my medical certificate so I could keep training and work towards a solo. Unfortunately I was deferred due to my medical background. This is nothing new; we see these posts every week or so. I just want to say to anyone out there fighting through the deferral process: KEEP FIGHTING IT! Do whatever your AME tells you that you need to do. Give them all the required information! The end result is worth it! It took me 10 months to get my medical approved. Between all the battery of tests I needed to complete, an incompetent psychologist who couldn't even evaluate his own results, and the government shutdown, it was a grueling and tiring year. Many times I told my wife I was going to quit. I said it wasn't worth flying if I had to be subjected to all of this. 

I. Was. Wrong.

In March I was awarded my 3rd class medical, and soon after I took my first solo flight. For all of you out there waiting for the approval, I'm telling you now that the first solo flight makes it worthwhile. Everything else is icing on the cake. I still haven't decided if I want to pursue BasicMed or continue with 3rd class, but it is so liberating to be on the other side of that discussion, rather than wondering when it'll ever come.

A month after my solo flight, the CFI that I had been working with and I got into a serious fight. I won't go into those details, because I still respect the man and wish not to dirty his name or image (even if no names are given). He and I had a differing of opinions and needed to part ways. I went to a local school at an airport closer to home and began my training from what seemed like scratch.

At my original school I had been flying Warriors. The new school flew 172s. For a month I felt like I had become a complete novice again. It was disheartening, but in the end I feel that this made me a better pilot. The rating is for Airplane Single Engine Land, and I feel now that I have the tools and the knowledge to fly a ASEL regardless of low wing or high wing profile. This is one of the few setbacks that I now realize was a blessing. An expensive blessing... but still a blessing.

From May until September I practiced everything I could to make sure I was prepared to be a pilot. All the XC work, all of the night flight, the whole 9 yards. Today, 9/11/19, I became a private pilot. A full 530 days since my journey began. All of the setbacks, all of the delays, all of the heartache, all totally worth it. I apologize if this is rambling at this point. The exhilaration still has not worn off, and I'm wondering if it ever will.

&amp;#x200B;

**Checkride Write-up:**

8:30 DPE enters the flight school and we begin talking. He assures me that the test is not intended to be stressful and wants me to do my best flying and not be a jittery bundle of nerves.

8:40 - 9:00 IACRA paperwork and digital signatures.

9:00 - 9:30 DPE examines my logbook and endorsements. This was one of the most stressful sections of the test. I knew I had everything, but he was scrutinizing every little detail. I half expected him to pull out a chart to make sure all of my XC had a straight line distance of over 50 nm (they did, but he did not go that far).

9:30 - 11:00 Oral exam: We covered a lot of material, so it will probably be out of order. He started by asking me how I would know if I was current/proficient. Then went straight into determining if the A/C was airworthy. We went through the manuals and I gave him grave detail about each one of the inspections and what was being looked for. He didn't ask any follow up questions, so I assume everything went A-OK. One point to note was that the A/C we were in was not IFR capable. I made sure to bring up the inspections we would need though we lacked the equipment.

Next steps were to go over the Weight and Balance of the plane. The DPE had sent my CFI a ""cargo manifest"" of sorts the day before. It listed the weights of the passengers, and baggage. What was interesting wasn't the actual W&amp;B calculations, it was the the DPE actually asked me to change it on the fly and recalculate it (e.g. ""if we don't take the bags and instead take full fuel, how does that effect us?"")

Immediately after we went over the XC plan and weather. I was allowed to use Foreflight to go over the weather, which was nice because I had gotten a briefing from 1800WXBRIEF earlier this morning, but explaining the charts was so much easier than going over the briefing. This also allowed me to update my paper chart to include current winds aloft. Don't forget to talk about potential NOTAMS and TFRs if you area has any!!!

While we had the XC sectional open the DPE began to play a game of point and tell, where he would point to a section of the map and ask for your response. He was very particular about the dimensions of class E, as well as a couple of MOAs that are nearby our airport. He didn't go into too much depth with this, but I can easily see a DPE trying to trip up a student will all of the little complexities in the sectional.

Lastly we had a scenario to go over. Essentially I was asked to take two friends to an airport in a rental archer, where they would then pay me for the ride. List all appropriate regulations against this.

11:15 - 2:00 Oral exam passed, onto the flight portion. Preflight went smooth. I expected questioning at this point but was given very little. A thorough pax brief is always advisable so they don't have too many questions for you. Taxi and run up were uneventful. At this point the winds were reasonable 30 degrees off the center line with only 7 knots. Takeoff was good but as soon as we lifted off the turbulence began. And it never stopped...

We flew to our first checkpoint and got flight following from the air. We had barely gotten to our second checkpoint when I was told to cancel flight following and divert to... the towered field I began my training at. My first landing was right on the mark (which I don't think I've ever done)! We brief a short field takeoff and landing and do the takeoff. Tower directs me to change to right traffic for a cub that's incoming.  On final the DPE tells me to stop the maneuver and go around.  He then instructs me do a soft field landing the next time around. This was a complete surprise to me but mission accomplished. On the ground he instructs me to brief him for a soft field takeoff and that we will do the short field landing at our home airport.

On the way back home it's time for the foggles. I really felt like I screwed this part up. I normally love unusual attitudes, but today my mind just wanted to play tricks on me. I felt like I was going left when we were in a dive, etc. The takeaway is trust your instruments and your procedures! A couple of constant airspeed climbs and turns to a heading, and the foggles were off.

So now we are on our way back home. Just the short field landing left. I tune to our home AWOS... and the winds are now 90 degrees off centerline, 10 knots gusting to 20.... I'd say what's on my mind but this is a family friendly sub.

I had to go around twice. I was bouncing all over the place. The third time around I finally put the plane on the ground... I think.. I thought it bounced and personally I felt like that was it. I assumed my checkride was over and that I'd need to redo the short field work. I know I certainly thought that landing was horrific. The few people who were on the ground later told me the landing looked much nicer from the ground than it did in the air. The DPE though so because he never told me it was unsatisfactory!

We took about 15 minutes to debrief. There were certainly elements of my ride that we not up to par but still acceptable. I could've been more active on my checklists. Some of my checks were just plain wrong, and I really need to work on keeping the plane lined up on the extended centerline... but that's why they call it a license to learn! All things I now know to be more conscience of. All in all I'm relieved to be done with the first checkride. I'm just hoping the adrenaline wears off so I can focus on my IR.

387,What would it take to revive a closed airport? (KAIY),"I just found out the AOPA forums (aka Red Board) is being closed and I was perusing my old threads there.  One of them was about an old airport that, has been closed for a long while now.  I think it's been closed almost 13 years now but google maps still shows that the runways are in pretty much the same condition just with a few XXXs over the numbers.

388,Sextant use in flying?,"When learning pilotage, why is there no instrument that can tell you the exact angle between two objects in view? 

I'm thinking it's a relatively simple device: two joined tubes,  like a binoculars,  with crosshairs,  magnification optional. Then you can move one of the scopes to find an object. Let's say a mountain peak or water tower. Then when you can look at two things at once,  and have your crosshairs overlap. You now know your angle between those two things. 

Then you can triangulate on the map two places where that's possible. And it should be obvious which of the two points it is.

I've been flying both RC and simulation for years and I'm confident you could throw me in one without electronics and I'd be successful. However, when comparing lessons and rental rates the difference between planes and helis is insane. I can rent a piper for $130/hr, or an R44 for $375/hr. So it's really pulling on my heart strings which way I want to go. I can more easily and readily afford planes, but if my heart is always going to pull me towards helis will a fixed wing PPL satisfy me when all is said and done?

Also, I'm only 24. I know in the far future when I make more money a heli license may be more obtainable. But for now I'm talking about getting started in a year or two.",flying,1568249371,Ghostman223,12,3,True,2019-09-11

394,Aviation Programs for Veterans,"Hello everyone,

I am relatively new to this page and Reddit. I was recently discharged from the military and discovered the opportunities I have available with the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill in terms of flight training. It seems financially beneficial to attain a degree in Aviation rather than do flight training alone. I have found two schools I am most interested in, one is Central Oregon Community College and the other being the University of North Dakota. However, if you know of other veteran friendly Aviation schools, please let me know!

My end goal like many is to become an airline pilot, but I would also like to explorer other careers in aviation like firefighter pilot and LifeFlight (I was a medic in the Army and want to continue helping people in some way). I have a B.A. in Political Science and I understand many major airlines prefer pilots to have a Bachelor's, but does it need to be in Aviation, Engineering, or another related field?

COCC offers a 2-year fixed-wing program where you earn your PPL, Instrument Rating, Commercial Rating, Multi-Engine Rating, CFI, CFII, and MEI. You also earn a A.A.S in Aviation. You also gain experience flying around mountains and various environments.

UND offers a 4-year fixed-wing program and you earn all of the same certificates above other than the MEI. You also earn a B.S. in Commercial Aviation. UND has pathway programs with Delta, United, Sun Country, JetBlue, and SkyWest.

With the experienced pilots in the thread, I would greatly appreciate it if someone could give me advice to assist me along this new journey of mine. What would you do in my situation?

399,Emergency Landing at Boston - Your thoughts?,"Okie dokes, I have been meaning to ask the community about a situation I got into about a month ago. It still kinda eats at me so I want to get some opinions to try to lay this thing to rest.

It was about 11PM, 40nm west of the Boston airport. I was on the way to Laconia NH after departing Linden NJ under the Trump TFR (took forever to get released). I noticed my radios start to go, electrical equipment fail, bla bla bla... Typical alternator failure stuff. I never internalized it as an alternator failure, I kinda freaked out went was just thinking ""OMG EVERYTHING IS DYING"" and I think that was the first mistake. Anyways, I look outside and the closest well-lit area was Boston. So I turn towards there, squawk 7700 and attempt to reach tower/police etc on my cell phone. Eventually over downtown I got ahold of the tower on my cell phone and they cleared me in as an emergency. 

The guys at Boston were super nice and were very happy I got in, no judgement there. I caught some funny reactions from my peers at home, and it kinda made me feel like shit. They were wondering why I didn't just go to a local class D or C (there were several that were closer) and my answer is... Tunnel vision. I just got so fixated on Boston and I was really freaked out with no lights and no radios. 

I know I can't change anything now, but what I can say is I feel like I did the right thing at the time. I didn't just barrel in, I got ahold of someone and made sure I was good to go. I stayed out of the way of their traffic. The only thing I did without telling anyone was bust their Bravo airspace, but as an emergency, that was within my right and I never heard about it from anyone.

I am 25 years old, located in Scandinavia and live close to where they have their base of operation in Sweden, so it's very convenient for me to choose OSM Aviation Academy. 

By any chance, does anyone here have any experience with this academy? Maybe you studied there yourself or know someone who did? Would you say its a good education? 

The subjects you study there are;

**Phase 1**

1. Meteorology (MET)
2. Principles of Flight (POF)
3. Communications (COM) - IFR and VFR
4. Human Performance and limitations (HPL)

**Phase 2**

1. Radio Navigation (RNAV)
2. General Navigation (GNAV)
3. Air Law (ALW)
4. Airframes, Powerplants, and Systems (ASP)

**Phase 3**

1. Instrumentation (INS)
2. Flight Planning and Monitoring (FPM)
3. Operational Procedures (OPP)
4. Mass and Balance (M&amp;B)
5. Performance (PER)

I want to do this so badly but since I don't have any experience in this it's very hard for me to tell if this is good.

And the last question is, with this education, would you say that getting a job at an airline is something that could happen? My biggest fear is not getting a job and having to work with something unrelated.

Some of the non-profits have had to stand down due to complexities (red tape) of international aid, but the NATCA disaster committee is not having these issues with our volunteers.

My original thought was that an increase in airspeed results in both greater drag and lift. So since induced drag is from the presence of lift itself, that means more drag(all types). 

Answer was wrong and the explanation was that as the airspeed decreases, the wings require a greater amount of lift to keep the plane flying so induced drag goes up. 

This goes against everything I learned in school.  Lift is proportional to the square of velocity.  One increases so does the other. If the plane slows, lift is drastically reduced as there is less airflow over the wings.",flying,1568318017,brk51,33,4,True,2019-09-12

450,Military medical disqualification and AME mistake,"Hey y’all,

I have a chest problem called pectus excavatum which I had a pretty big surgery to correct (still a pretty noticeable dip, but better) and ended up getting DoDMERB Disqualification from AFROTC. I was able to get a 1st class medical before my surgery and got a 1st class two years after it woth my disqualification falling between the two. 

When I got my most recent 1st class medical (2ish months ago) I put down I had never been DQ’d from military service because in the heat of the moment I thought MEPs was a real disqualification while DoDMERB for a mere college cadet was more of a “you can’t enroll in AFROTC anymore, but you can try post graduation” type gig which led to me saying I had never been medically disqualified. 

When I get my next first class medical, what could potentially happen if I mark down I was dropped from the military? Is that a huge red flag for AME’s?",flying,1568337244,pilotlad21,6,1,True,2019-09-12

453,Air Force Reserve UPT,"I currently have (what I think is) a pretty successful career as a flight dispatcher under way. I'm almost 24 and near a natural transition point in that career to a major airline. I've been seriously considering applying with AFRES units for a UPT slot. Given the upcoming career stage transition I'm looking at, I figure that taking a few years off in between for AFRES pilot training and any required ART time would work well, as I'd still be in my late 20s when theoretically resuming my dispatch career at a major airline while also flying for the Reserve. I'll hold off from my whole story as I'm sure you guys have heard variants of it a million times. What my questions come down to are:

1) Prior to college, I received an NROTC scholarship but was unable to pass the DoDMERB color vision testing for the Navy. I got a B.S. degree and a PPL as a civilian, while passing the FAA's operational color vision test (OCVT/MFT) with a local FSDO. I now have an FAA LoE that I present for flight physicals that says I am color vision normal in the view of the FAA. There is no color vision restriction on my FAA PPL.

Given the recent AF policy change on the CCT (55 passes with waiver), I think it would be worth at least attempting a flight physical. The research I've done says that a recruiter can get you set up for a flight physical. Is it possible to do the flight physical prior to going through most of the steps listed here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/a8c3iq/how\_to\_apply\_to\_air\_force\_reserveguard\_units](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/a8c3iq/how_to_apply_to_air_force_reserveguard_units/))? I would like to know if I'm qualified or able to get a waiver prior to being fully committed and/or wasting everyone's time.

2) I understand that the CCT isn't a shoe-in compared to the traditional plate test, but I feel that I at least have a shot since I passed the FAA color vision test. If I am unable to pass the CCT, but I'm reasonably close, does the FAA LoE or my unrestricted PPL/FAA class I medical give me some decent waiver ammunition? I know that FAA medical does not equal AF class I flight physical.

3) I would very much like to fly for the Reserve - it's always been a goal of mine to serve. I just wasn't able to via the traditional ROTC/active duty path a few years ago (see above). Now that I have a good career that I would like to continue to pursue, do those of you in the Reserves/ANG think it's worth going through the years of training/possible ART? I don't think it would damage my current progress in dispatch - if anything, the military service would probably help on my major airline applications a few years down the road. I know most guys go down the airline pilot path after training and on part time status, so I'm a little unique in that regard.

&amp;#x200B;

458,Avplan vs Paper maps - How would you go about it?,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Here in Australia, all exams and flight tests that would include navigation require you to have paper charts to use in the exam and you are required to know how to use one. That's great and all, and absolutely fair enough. It's nice to have a backup and to do it the old fashioned way; it's also very fun.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I've known people who have used their paper maps for the first couple of navs, then get an EFB and use that because of the ease of use and then come exam time and flight test time, they immediately regret not using paper maps. I don't know what the law is in America and such, but it seems EFB's are far more ""accepted"" over there; whereas here if you bring an EFB into the cockpit of your flight test, the testing officer will throw your iPad out the window.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be worth using an EFB just for the ease of use? Say, do all your paper charts and plan that up, then in flight use an EFB such as Avplan? Or how would you best retain the knowledge of paper charts while using an EFB? Or just don't even bother and ride it out until I'm finished with my training up to CPL?

465,Constant-speed Pitch Propeller - Cessna 177RG,"Hi Everyone, I would like to share my experience flying a constant speed propeller Cessna 177RG:

For the complex endorsement, I have started with a 1975 Cessna Cardinal 177RG (C177RG), apart from being considered a complex airplane, it also has additional horsepower and some extra weight. I am writing the following as the highlights from fight instructor classes I have undertaken, and especially a lot of pattern circuit work (touch &amp; goes) to perfect landing the Cardinal, including many crosswind landings.

**Constant-speed pitch propeller (aka. variable pitch propeller)**

The first thing you notice is that the there are three knobs, usually : throttle (black lever), propeller (blue knob) or mixture (red knob), the blue knob is sometime is black, but positioned in the centre between the throttle lever and mixture knobs. Both the propeller and mixture knobs are turning knobs for precision.

**Note:**

* Throttle (black lever)  -  for manifold pressure (MP)
* Propeller (blue knob) - for RPM
* Mixture (red knob) - for fuel mixture

For take off the throttle and propeller knobs should be in the full forward position, and the mixture should also be in full forward position or set for best power (consult POH). 

During taxi, use the throttle lever (black) as in a fixed pitch propeller plane, and keep the propeller and mixture knobs in the full forward position. This is also the recommended configuration for takeoff, approach and landing.

During flight (cruise), RPM and MP should be set as required, and any major changes for climbing or descending should be handled as follows:

**Increase power (climbing):**

First, the propeller knob to raise the RPM

Second, the throttle lever to raise the MP

**Reduce power (descending):**

First, the throttle lever to decrease the MP

Second, the propeller knob to decrease the RPM

**Note:**

I would recommend not touching the throttle (black lever knob), propeller (blue knob) or mixture (red  knob) until you are at safe altitude after takeoff.

**Starting the Engine** When starting the engine, I have not yet experienced any issues with a cold engine start. First, I prime the engine with the fuel pump. I begin with the master on and throttle in 1/4 inch (1/2 if flooded), propeller set to high RPM (pushed inward), fuel pump on and mixture full rich. The fuel flow gauge should show up to 4 - 6 gallons per hour (GPH) in roughly 6 seconds. Fuel pump off and cut-off the mixture. The engine is now primed, the above should be omitted if the engine is warm.

Turn the key in the starter to crank the engine, and as soon as the engine fires, slowly move the mixture to full rich and adjust the throttle to 1000 RPM, and check oil pressure in green within 30 seconds. 

**TIP:** Don’t crank the engine for more than 10 seconds, as the starter heats up and needs to rest before trying again. Each time the engine is cranked; the engine requires more fuel, and the engine may need to be primed again using the fuel pump, always confirming their is sufficient pressure on the fuel flow gauge.

&amp;#x200B;

**Circuit &amp; Landing**

Every plane is different, and there is no exception with the Cardinal, the landings are handled differently to its little brother the Cessna 172. The circuit speed also needs to be considered, as the extra horsepower really gets you moving on the downwind leg. 

I find it important to start controlling the speed as soon as you turn into downwind (after climbing), moving the throttle (black) lever back until the manifold pressure (MP) reads 21 and slowly rotating the propeller (blue) knob back to 2,300 revolutions per minute (RPM), aiming at 115 MPH, and trimming to 95 MPH at about halfway along the downwind leg seems to work fine for me. 

Once in beam with the runway numbers, I start to prepare and configure the plane for landing. First, landing light on, put in 10 degrees of flaps, and move the engine controls to full rich and full RPM. I continue by lowering the landing gear at no higher than 95 MPH. With the confirmation of the green landing gear light I know I am right to go. As the speed stabilizes, I start to turn and descend on base and trim to 80 MPH. On turning on final, I double-check the landing configuration, the landing light, landing gear, flaps, full rich, and full RPM (and landing gear again). 

**Landing**

On landing I find the Cardinal fun, as it is different to both the Piper Warrior and Cessna 172, apart from the retractable landing gear, it is more sensitive on the controls (I assume because of the its huge stabilator). 

Once on final, I aim at 80 MPH, and basically glide the Cardinal to the runway, maintaining the correct height from the ground, I may need to throttle a little on a windy day, and never allow the speed to get below 80 MPH. 

Once over the runway, I hold its position and allow the plane to settle on the runway, if I balloon during the flare I never push forward on the controls, I just hold it and allow the plane to land. If needed I give a little back pressure on the controls. In case of ballooning too high, and the rate of decent continues to be high, I throttle a little to cushion the landing.Once on the runway, avoid being aggressive on the brakes, avoid them and allow the Cardinal to slow down before using the brakes.

That’s it.    

**TIP:** The doors on the Cardinal are huge, so it is important to keep this in mind on windy days. Be very careful opening the doors as they do not have struts to limit their forward opening motion, and the force generated by wind can certainly damage the door hinges. It is important to avoid any unnecessary repairs.

467,911 Dispatcher with questions about Airline Dispatching,"Hi! I've been a 911 Operator for coming up on 2 years now. It's getting to the point where I need to make a decision if I want to hunker down and do this for the rest of my life or look elsewhere. That is what has led me to doing a little bit of research onto Airline Dispatcher.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started reading about jobs that don't require a degree. I figured it had the word 'dispatch' in it so some skills were probably transferable. As I mentioned I've done some very light googling, maybe 30 minutes at this point but wasn't really getting answers for the questions I had. I'll list them off in no particular order below!

&amp;#x200B;

1. I understand I need certification but I'm not even really sure how to go about that. I found this website Sheffield which teaches it but it's at a physical location. I'm really nervous to quit my job and just go to school for 5 weeks. Even the online course as a mandatory one week at the school.

&amp;#x200B;

2. What do I even do with the certification after I get it? Do I then just go to various regional airports and apply? I understand that you have to get experience before working for major airlines but what does it mean to work at a regional airport? I guess this is a good time to mention I have no experience with flight, airplanes, or any of that. Would I just be monitoring private planes?

&amp;#x200B;

3. What does a day in the job look like? I get that it is a very meticulous and calculating job but I still don't have a good idea what I'd actually be doing. Monitoring weather, checking airport statuses? I'm not really sure. I know of flight plans (from watching airforce proud, mainly) but I don't know what that actually is. Also how much free time do you have throughout the day? At my current job depending on how busy we are it's not uncommon to watch netflix, browse reddit, or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

4. ARE any skills transferable from 911 operator to this? The most important I could think of would be knowledge of computer aided dispatch, multi tasking, and ability to perform under stress. A grand simplification of my job is answering 911 calls and handling life threatening emergencies, talking to officers over radio and handling any emergencies they might be involved in, and managing what calls to go to and in what order.

&amp;#x200B;

5.  In the event of an emergency what parts is the dispatcher handling? Are they the ones contacting airports, EMS, police, anything else that is needed? Also what is the actual pilot to dispatcher interaction? How often are you really talking to them throughout the flight? And how many flights are you monitoring at once?

&amp;#x200B;

6. I think this is my final one. Probably could have been asked in question 2 but whatever. Where do you actually work? At the airport, the airlines headquarters, or something else? For instance I'm in North Carolina. Largest airport near me is Charlotte, and Piedmont Triad International in greensboro is only about 20 minutes from me. Would I be able to work at one of these or is this a job that if I wanted to work for a major airline I would need to relocate?

489,First Solo Flight (need some data),"So I’m in a statistics class and for a project I have to collect my own data on a certain topic. Since Flying has become a fun thing for me since I’m in training, I thought this would be a great easy place to get some data. Please upvote so I can get as many people as possible to answer! Thank you guys

My question is: How many hours of flight time did it take for you to do your first solo?",flying,1568414918,xsych123,17,0,True,2019-09-13

491,PPL Oral Write-up,"It feels a little weird to not be studying a few minutes today for my PPL Oral, but I passed yesterday! Discontinued the flight portion because the ceiling was too low to do the airwork portions of the flight. The DPE seemed pretty happy with the oral so I figured I'd write my debrief of it here in case anyone else is preparing and finds it helpful (and I probably won't do a ""passed my checkride"" photo and post just to deny the r/Shittyaskflying crowd the material ;) ). There's a tl;dr at the bottom as this got a bit long.

The day before: I did a mock checkride (including the oral) with a CFI who I haven't flown with before, but also instructs in our club (and, fortuitously as it would turn out, is the owner of the airplane I'm using). The oral went well with him and we took off about 10:30 on my planned XC from KSFB to KCRG, the same one I planned for the actual checkride. Good radio work and no drama exiting the Class C airspace, and as expected, around the 3rd checkpoint the CFI started complaining that breakfast was disagreeing with him so we diverted to 28J. Did a short field landing (which SUCKED but it was my first landing in a month), so we decided to practice a few more there at Palatka. On my 4th landing, the left main tire blew out, so we were dead on runway 9 while ops came out to try their new jack for the first time. Thankfully there was a courtesy car and we grabbed lunch while the tire was changed. Back out to the plane, departed 28J and did steep turns, stalls, slow flight, and ground ref. During the turns around a point I noticed the fuel flow meter was blinking oddly, and shortly after that the backup ammeter also started blinking. The CFI (remember, the owner of the plane) said he had half a mind to ask the avionics shop to just take them out. Headed back to Sanford for soft-field and a normal landing. Climbing out from the touch and go for the soft-field, the G430 and G796 both fail. The CFI recognized it as an alternator failure (thank goodness he was the owner and we didn't have to call someone else and explain why we broke their plane) and we got clearance to land, got back on the ground, and had the mechanics look it over that evening. I got a call around 7:30 that the plane was good to go for the next morning, so I did a new nav log with updated winds, did weight &amp; balance, and packed everything up for the next morning.

The morning of the ride: I woke up before the alarm (cursed checkride nerves) and headed to the airport. Pulled the plane out, taxied to the FBO, and got into the conference room (I'd reserved it in advance). I laid out my documents in the following order--my qualifications (student pilot license, medical, knowledge test report, logbook, passport), the aircraft qualifications (maintenance binder with ADs and required inspections, registration, airworthiness certificate, operating limitations, and weight &amp; balance card), cross-country information (sectional, nav log, the printouts of the airport diagrams for the destination airport and all plausible diversion airports), and printouts of the weather information used to plan the cross-country (winds aloft, departure and destination TAFs, and prog chart). I also had a stack of my personal reference materials (lightly tabbed FAR/AIM, my personal notebook, my cell phone, and the aircraft checklist). 

The DPE came in right at 8:00 and we shook hands. His demeanor was warm, which I think helped a lot. He went through the basics of the checkride and started examining my documents. He spent the most time on the logbook, including starting to check distances on the cross-countries, until I showed him my logbook index which broke it all down and listed the routes and distances for each XC. He did complain about me double-dipping cross-country and hood time, but I have about 3x as much XC as needed so it didn't really matter. Once he decided I was qualified, he grabbed the maintenance binder. He's done a checkride in the plane before so didn't spend a lot of time on the maintenance--no real questions about anything, though he had me show him the pitot/static check and the 100-hour (a weird one, there's a new engine in the plane so the 100-hour inspection is actually the return-to-service from the engine replacement). 

After looking the logs over, he had me acknowledge the pilot's bill of rights, told me about the ground rules (I can look things up, no trick questions, questions might have multiple good/correct answers, I can discontinue at any time), and we got started. He started with maintenance questions: who can perform an annual inspection? Who can perform a 100-hour inspection? What can a pilot do maintenance-wise? I answered with brief but complete answers (e.g. - anyone overseen by a repairman with inspection authorization can perform an annual). He seemed satisfied fairly quickly with those answers, so we moved on: personal minimums, stall/spin awareness, aerodynamics, systems, airspace, etc. - all of the areas I expected to be covered except weather and navigation, which I was assuming would come during the review of the cross country. Most of the questions were at a level a little below what I had prepared for. It seemed like he would ask a few, be satisfied I was okay in that area, and then either move on or decide to ask a couple ""bonus"" questions. When he did that, he'd tell me they were advanced questions or that he was curious, and that I didn't need to answer correctly in order to pass. For example, he would say ""This is more commercial-level, but without using the term 'cushion of air', can you describe ground effect? And does your true airspeed go up or down while you're flying in ground effect?"" (I vaguely remembered this from the PHAK, but true airspeed increases in ground effect because the induced drag is decreased). I tried to use examples in my answers from things I had experienced, which encouraged him to share anecdotes as well. 

After about 40 minutes of the oral, he asked me to modify my weight &amp; balance card (scenario: Steve from the FAA wanted to ride along, he weighed 150 lbs. and would sit in the back seat, can we still go?) and left the room for a few minutes. I redid the calculations, ate a donut and grabbed a water, and the DPE came back in. He looked at the card briefly, said it looked good, and we moved on to the cross-country part. He asked what I'd done to see if the weather was OK, and I told him I'd gotten a briefing on the iPad but that I could have called 1-800-WX-BRIEF and reviewed TAFs and winds aloft. He stopped me before I said I'd reviewed the prog charts or that I'd printed the weather. Those were the ONLY weather-related questions. The nav log review was also quite brief. He wanted to know why I'd chosen the altitude I had and if I had any concerns about the route of flight (it goes directly over KDED which has parachute activity, so I circled around it). He told me I'd passed the oral and that we should check the weather and go flying. We both walked outside, looked at the clouds, and I told him that my personal minimum for stalls and steep turns was 2000 feet--and there was a broken layer over the practice area at about 2300. He seemed happy with my decision to discontinue, we scheduled for next Wednesday, and sat around for another 40 minutes doing paperwork and chit-chatting about various experiences and certain local part 141 schools. 

Overall impressions: I felt like this guy was rooting for me--not that he'd intentionally go easy on the exam but that he genuinely hoped I'd do well. I could also tell when he was satisfied with my knowledge of an area, because he'd invent a question designed to test the limits of my knowledge that was more complex than the previous questions (i.e. going from ""what does '225 L 29 122.7(C)' mean underneath this airport"" to ""tell me about this grey line"" and showing me a TRSA, of which there are none in Florida). I haven't done the flight test yet, but I'm more confident now than I was going into the oral--so  for others who are getting ready for checkrides, know that the oral isn't always scary! I wish the weather had been a bit better, because now we have to wait for a tropical storm to pass before going up again (and I am ready to be DONE with this process), but I'm glad this part is complete.",flying,1568418307,jamyvii,30,113,True,2019-09-13
492,Flight School Advice,"(Thanks in advance for any help you can give)

I’m currently a senior music major at U of Michigan. I plan on going to flight school next year, I am almost done with my private pilot and have been obsessed with aviation for years. 

I am trying to be crafty, and maybe save some money by getting some sort of graduate assistantship in music at a college that also has an aviation program. The goal would be for the tuition waiver to cover tuition, and I’d just have to cover the flight costs. This would also allow the use of lower interest federal loans, and deferment of my current loans. I’m not sure what the feasibility of getting a masters in music and a bachelors in aviation at the same time are, but I’m sure it’s remotely possible. 

I’m open to other suggestions, namely how I could use a graduate assistantship in music as a way to cover living expenses and spending money while I’m getting the required aviation certifications. Perhaps a college with a flight school nearby, or something like that. 

Let me know if you have any kind of suggestions, and again thank you so much for your help!",flying,1568420968,Metzfan33,11,3,True,2019-09-13

If I can buy one type of ground school that covers commercial topics and basics/systems/information about multi engine that would be cool too.
