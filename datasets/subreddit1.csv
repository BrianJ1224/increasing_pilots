61,Should I get a surface pro or an ipad?,"Not sure if this is the right sub but

Im thinking of getting the surface pro 6 or an ipad pro for college. This will be my first very own laptop and I want to make sure I got the best one.

I need something that can run word, powerpoint, open multiple tabs while working (but still fast), and other things.

I also want to do digital notes so that it wont be a hassle to buy different pens and other things. The ipad pro has goodnotes which I think is the best app since I see a lot of people use it for note taking.

I also think a surface pro would be great since it runs full windows 10. Onenotes is great but the ipad pro has this 'feel' to it which makes it seem nicer to use. Maybe the problem is the surface pen idk.

I dont know what I should get but I know I would want a 2 in 1 laptop.",technology,1577845779,penguinswithtuxedos,4,1,True,2019-12-31

164,Is Uber Doomed to a Point of No Return? They operate like an economic and political institution," Uber is a [bubble](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/), they are a danger to the gig economy, they are a hazard to society, a virus to capitalism, [adversely impact economic welfare](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html), and abuser to the [republic](https://promarket.org/uber-and-the-sherlock-holmes-principle-how-control-of-data-can-lead-to-biased-academic-research/). Uber is simply a scam, a racket, and they have got this far by:

* Having the [best Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-best-biglaw-firms-according-to-general-counsel/?rf=1), political shadow bosses, and lobbyists to sustain their anti-regulation and anti-labor rights strategy in efforts to sustain market power with a non-feasible and [unsustainable business model](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/).
* Successfully manufacturing [false narratives](https://promarket.org/false-claims-and-propaganda-why-ubers-narratives-are-wrong-but-successful/) by [manipulating journalists](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/).
* Recruit and exploit their supply/commodity (i.e. drivers) by using [deceptive practice](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/18/uber-travis-kalanick-scandal-pr-disaster-timeline). They work effortlessly to ensure that their supply does not have a platform to attain basic labor rights. They are assertive on dodging any expenses associated with unemployment insurance and [workers’ comp](https://promarket.org/antitrust-labor-market-protectionist-pro-competitive/). All this in order to avert paying basic taxes a normal business is required to pay the IRS. Uber places the tax burden on their poor and poverty-income level drivers.
* Having an elite, [A-team of economists](https://qz.com/1367800/ubernomics-is-ubers-semi-secret-internal-economics-department/) (i.e. Ubernomics) working in-house for Uber to step up their lobbyist and policymakers for success. The Ubernomic team conducts [think tanks](https://qz.com/1367800/ubernomics-is-ubers-semi-secret-internal-economics-department/) at the firm to navigate and shape their socioeconomic schemes to fit and complement their business model.
* Using their own employees to fabricate “[academic research](https://promarket.org/ubers-academic-research-program-how-to-use-famous-economists-to-spread-corporate-narratives/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork)” and attach famous economists names to valid their [narratives](https://promarket.org/false-claims-and-propaganda-why-ubers-narratives-are-wrong-but-successful/) with the objective to create and change public policy.
* Innovating [uncompetitive economies](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html) and rapidly dominating their industry at the global stage by ensuring a lack of competition remains in place.
* [Ruthlessly](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html) securing their [global dominance and deregulation](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/) by using a strategy of “[growth at any cost](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/).”
* Price-fixing (hint-hint for the legal minds), bypassing decades-old [anti-trust laws](https://promarket.org/antitrust-labor-market-protectionist-pro-competitive/) and being pillars of molding [anti-trust](https://promarket.org/antitrust-labor-market-protectionist-pro-competitive/) in [labor markets](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22843.pdf) that threaten civil liberties.
* Having a [robust PR](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/) department engaged in propaganda backed by shadow bosses and elites eager to please the firm.
* Their business strategy to increase their margin is composed of flooding the markets with supply (drivers), increasing the price on the customers, and [decreasing their drivers’ pay rate](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/).
* Their comprehensive business development strategy is entirely a [political process](https://promarket.org/the-uber-bubble-why-is-a-company-that-lost-20-billion-claimed-to-be-successful/) by infiltrating and hacking the political system. They are an equal opportunity discriminator on human dignity and they have bipartisan support to change and create public policy.

It is important to shed light on these sophisticated techniques carried out by a company that inflects irreversible damage to societies and economies. What is more disturbing is that the company gets away with making [false claims](https://promarket.org/false-claims-and-propaganda-why-ubers-narratives-are-wrong-but-successful/) and manipulating the public, journalists, and the media. The company operates a bonafide [PR propaganda machine](https://promarket.org/ubers-academic-research-program-how-to-use-famous-economists-to-spread-corporate-narratives/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork) which is very effective at manipulating the media and the company’s image. Hypothetically speaking, if I was a foreign entity with adverse intentions wanting to disguise myself as a company, and my objective was to destabilize societies and sow discourse between the people and their governments, I would probably name the company Uber and get my [seed capital from Saudi](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-03/the-inside-story-of-how-uber-got-into-business-with-the-saudi-arabian-government).",technology,1577914162,Open_c_Source,11,1,True,2020-01-01

A friend just gave me 2 different power banks. I charged them (charging works fine, they both have 4 dots indicating the cells once they're fully charged) and one of them has a ""flashlight"" function, and they both have 4 leds to indicate the charge. I both took them and plugged in my phone, but it didn't charge.

The power banks (they're 2 completly different ones), seem to just ""crash"" when you plug in an usb and connect it to a device. 

Now here's something I've tried: I took the one with the flashlight, turned the flashlight on, and once I put the USB port in my phone, the flashlight turns off, once I pull the power-bank out it works again. The other power-bank is the same, I connect the USB to a device and it stops illuminating the charge indicating lights.

I think this is weird, as I am convinced that both are full of charge (the flashlight works, the indicator also shows full in both) and this friend told me that they worked perfectly fine when he used it. Am I able to save these power-banks? I mean... they're useful... Anyways, thank you for reading this.",technology,1577970150,DutchPilot2,11,1,True,2020-01-02

 However the Middle East Netflix servers give me a certain type of content. 
 And theoretically, if I wanted to access different content from the Netflix servers in the USA, I should get a VPN and choose a Netflix server in the USA.

Is there a piece like this, or a way I could set up a tablet to do something like this? I could set it up for him, but I am a long drive away to do regular maintainance on it.

234,Done with HP," 

After months of trying to get my printer do to something that HP advertises it does, I'm done. 

The printer will not wake up to print a job, wirelessly, nor will it remember the wifi password after it falls asleep.

You can't stop it from falling asleep. HP calls it a feature, I call it a bug. 

They tell me to change to a Static IP. My provider doesn't allow that. 

So, I could get a new provider (only two in my area and this one is a good one) or I could replace the printer with a new one from a different company, probably Epson. 

I've used HP printers my whole life and have never run into a problem but this is ridiculous. They recognize that there is a problem however, will do nothing to fix it. 

I don't need this frustration and laziness on their part. 

I am putting this here because, since it is no longer under warranty, they won't talk to me and want to make this problem public. And I frustrated as hell. Yes, I'm aware that HP probably won't respond. Will be cancelling my Instant Ink order since the \*\*bleep\*\* printer can't communicate with HP because it loses wifi.

286,"How I built a flight price tracking business, thanks to accidentally running into my wife.","Hello, world!

I met my wife around 5 years ago - all thanks to being on the right flight at the right time. Funny thing is, I wasn't really supposed to be on that flight to Rome. As much as I loved traveling, I was a poor college student and I couldn't really afford the expensive flights.

And then it happened. I was looking for flights to random destinations after wrapping up my project report at 4 AM, and I found a round-trip ticket to Rome (from NYC) for \~$110! It was crazy because the usual prices are at least in the $350-400 range (if you're lucky).

I got super hooked to the idea of finding more trips for both myself and this girl I had met... ahem :D After I returned from the trip, I registered on a bunch of websites to get alerts if there was a price drop. I did get some good deals, but nothing was as crazy cheap as the one I had found for my trip to Rome.

I continued to manually find flights to 'random' destinations on Google flights and other websites, but it was a painful process. Plus, there was no way I could keep an eye on all these flight trackers 24x7 and create alerts for all the places that I really didn't know existed, but are AMAZING for travelers!

Being a student of Computer Science, I figured there must be some way for me to automate my process of looking through multiple travel sites for amazing deals to random destinations I wanted to travel.

So that's what I did. I created a service for myself that'd look for flights from across the internet that really was 'great' for their price. In the beginning, it simply sent API requests and had a bunch of if-else statements. However, over the years, I've added a bunch of Machine Learning and Deep Learning tricks to the algorithm.

Moreover, I have instances of my 'smart travel finder' running on around 14 different servers around the world (who knew looking for a flight from India is cheaper sometimes!).

I started getting lots of really interesting flights: \~$170 round-trip to Cancun, \~$230 to Paris, \~$340 to India... and so I decided to share it with family and friends and friends of friends. Once the list grew to over 200, I thought maybe people would be interested in paying for the service, and that's how [TripFate](https://tripfate.com/?ref=rxs1) was born.

TripFate can be tried for free (for as long as you want) and costs $25/year for the premium plan to cover the costs of the servers and allow me to dedicate more time for further development and support. I am not sure where this brainchild of mine will eventually end up, but it's definitely been a great experience so far!

As we technologists and programmers provide better and better artificial intelligence, do we have an ethical issue to help our communities overcome?  If a computer can do something better than a human, then is there any point to continuing in that endeavor as a human?  

For many this will be a silly question of course, because they understand the 1-dimensional nature of a dedicated AI in the current state of the art and the multifaceted nature of human development.  But the technology is bound to get MUCH better...

Imagine a world where virtually anything you can imagine will is done better by AIs.  At some point, AIs will exceed our ability to keep up with even creative endeavors, even to the point of developing a better human experience and sentience as we know it.  What then is the point of existing if humanity is defined by the limits of the frontiers it has pioneered and how do we define our purpose then if that is no longer possible?

In popular culture this is sure to become a theme at some point; perhaps even to the point of driving depression and suicides.  What answers will prevent this?",technology,1575362141,vplatt,0,1,True,2019-12-03

we can tell you that the final answer is NO!  
The truth is hundreds of second-used cellphone shops located in the Tongtiandi market, and they are offering all kinds of materials to do a refurbished phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

##  so What is the difference between Huaqiangbei and TongTianDi?

* The Huaqiangbei electronics market is the biggest wholesale electronics market in Shenzhen, China.
*  TongTianDi Market is a market for a second-hand mobile and parts  in Huaqiangbei.  
The following photos for your reference

📷  
As a result, it gave birth to quantities of refurbished smartphone workshops surrounding the TongTianDi Market.

##     2  Kinds of Refurbished Cellphone Suppliers you need to know 

     The first one is small. About 10-15 trained employees which are very good at refurbishing smartphones. and they usually focus on refurbishing a few phone models or just one brand. They normlly purchase the used mobiles and replacement parts from TongTianDi Market directly, often can not recycle.

     The second is large-sized manufacturers with employees above 100.and they are often in different teams. And each of these teams will be in charge of one working process, such as recycling second-hand mobile phones or used ones, refurbishing parts, assembleing machines, and so on.

So if you are going to wholesaling refurbished smartphones, we suggest you cooperate with largely-sized manufacturers like us.

📷

##      Our Advantages

*       Professional manufacturer team
*       Experiencing  quality-control team
*       Strong marketing team
*       Promising  *after-sale* *guarantee*

      In conclusion, Not only we offer a very competitive price but also can serve your products in the best condition. Thus to avoid unnecessary troubles.

315,"Hi, we are two furious bankers supporting the 99%, join #FridaysForPower to disrupt E-commerce future","Hello World,

Current market conditions became a protection racket for the rich companies. This is why the top 1% of the richest people become even richer and the rest 99% even more poor. The companies have gained the power to control the markets and the gap is increasing.

Who are we? We are two furious bankers and we are sick of money and the rich CEOs. We want to make a movement for bringing bargaining power back to us - the people because we are tired of shopping when consumers have no power.

We fight because we care, we fight because it's time to stop the tech giants and rich companies.  
[See journalists exposing how companies use data to sell you more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZVpbwz6kPk&amp;t=319s)

The world is built by companies in a way that us - the consumers have to do all the hard work searching, running for sales, discounts, Black Fridays, be manipulated with prices based on our data and have no power in telling what we want to buy and how much we want to pay for it.

We challenge it and the whole retail world to be wrong, why? Here is how current market works:

**- Consumers have no VOICE or POWER to bargain companies**  
You are just 1 person and you have no bargaining power in front of giant companies that created this retail world. And it barely helps with laws and regulations to control it. But what if we said we can all together create a new market, turn it upside down? What if instead of consumers running for Black Friday sales and hunt for products the companies would run to compete for you and try to win you as a customer? That feels like power is getting back to consumers.

**- The price of something is always equal to its value - wrong!**  
If you are the CEO like Amazon who is one of the richest people on earth but pays the lowest wages in the market, does he bring the same value to the world as his worth? Bullshit. People are paid for “what they have the power to negotiate”. Same with product prices! Why can’t we negotiate it in the shops? Fixed prices are there not because companies can’t afford to sell it cheaper, it’s because they became more powerful than consumers! Pretending to make us think this way! Putting sales and discounts so we would do the hard work searching and running around.

We fight to create the NEW MARKET for e-commerce, the “right market"" for everyone and we have the tool - [RVLhub.com](https://www.rvlhub.com) to do it, we are not doing it for the money, it’s not for profit! It's the start of a big movement and we follow these principals:

**- I can decide what I want to pay for my products/services**,   
I can put my own price tag and make myself Black Fridays every day.I don’t have to accept fixed prices in the shop. If I don’t get what I want, I reject it all and let companies do the hard work again trying to offer me the best price.

**- I can put a request deciding my own conditions**I   
can ask for eco-friendly products, support climate change companies or I can demand longer guarantees, faster delivery times etc. or else I don’t buy! No money - no company power.

**- Let companies do the hard work for my hard-earned money**  
Let them compete in a head to head direct competition with other companies for my requests. All I have to do is accept or reject. If I pay, they better work for my money.

**- No more manipulation on consumer data**  
Companies can’t see what I search, my age, my likes etc. no more data. I tell what I want and they give it to me!

We are 10K angry consumers and counting! Join the change in our [E-Commerce Forum](https://rvlhub.wixsite.com/rvlhubforum)

Currently, I use Google Photos and/or DropBox. But I found out DropBox isn't that great because people have found that it's not as secure as it should be (?). And well Google Photos is only somewhat secure even though it offers unlimited storage, which is what I was hoping to have.

 It's not a very long debate, and the answer to that may be pretty obvious, but I wonder what kind of blindness some entrepreneurs face today. For example, I've seen many cases of a company using open source technologies and to gain advantage over competition, develop things like extra functionality in the technology they use, attach all their systems to such functionality, it doesn't take long and the community is already far ahead of what they have developed, which makes the migration process much more difficult, while any other company that can adapt their systems to the new features developed by the community will be far ahead, which blinds them to the point of Instead of producing proprietary software that will soon be legacy, do not collaborate with open projects directly, so move forward so that they can adapt their implementations to it?",technology,1572843557,reb00t-one,5,2,True,2019-11-03

30,Need to catch a creep - best Android surveillance app?,"tl;dr: What are the best motion/audio activated surveillance apps for Android? Ideally one that uploads the footage to email or Youtube. Also any tips/ideas on how to catch this snooping weirdo/creep are welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancee has a room mate who we're convinced sneaks into her room. She and I talk on Discord a lot and we fall asleep together on there. She's 5 hours behind me so when I'm leaving in the morning it's 3am there. Twice before hanging up I've heard her bedroom door open and close.

&amp;#x200B;

Her laptop screen switches off so when they come in they can't see that someone is there, I saw them walking around once like they were looking for something. She's a deep sleeper and didn't hear anything herself at first. However the past two nights she's blatantly heard someone closing her door and leaving. She can't install a lock due to how old the doors are, they're a weird design. She put a necklace on the doorhandle and the sound of this is what woke her the past 2 nights. I was going to say barricade the door but now I want them to come in so we can catch them on video.

&amp;#x200B;

So the plan is for her to sit her phone somewhere in the room with a motion/sound activated surveillance app. I use iSpy for Windows for security cameras and am wondering if there's anything like that for Android maybe with more features?

As to documented lost time, you can receive payment for up to fifteen hours of time at an hourly rate of $25.00 per hour or unpaid time off work at your actual hourly rate, whichever is greater. If your lost time is not documented, you can receive payment for up to five hours at that same rate.

My question now is: Are people already working on that kind of technology?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean yes, we've got methods to move robot arms with our brain already, but I mean, have we already gotten as far as directly sending sensory information to our brain? Like providing an image to the brain and the smell, sound and feel? Are we capable of such things? Or do we have to research plenty more for that? 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that it's quite realistic to make a device that connects to your brain and while you are in a kind of coma for the time you're in-game it sends all the information directly to your brain.

With that, we could basically create new worlds, because like.. when our brains get the same information it would in the real world it would basically mean we ARE in that game - not physically but mentally. ( We could literally live in a StarWars Universe :DD )

Me: Majority of the places don't use wireless pay such as apple pay around here so, I have to use physical card and also all of this will make hard to opt for apple card.

79,Network Analysis,"**Network Analysis** 

**1.** **What is Network Analysis?**

Network analysis is used for recognizing the most efficient routes or paths for allocation of services. This involves finding the least-cost way in which to visit a destination location in a spatial network. The cost in a network analysis is normally described in terms of distance or travel time. Network analysis can also be used to optimize the allocation of resources.

**2.** **What is shortest path?**

The best route or the route of least impedance between two or more points, taking into account connectivity and travel restrictions. 

**3.** **What is service Area?**

A network service area is a region that encompasses all accessible streets (streets that are within a specified impedance).",technology,1567488313,grace992,4,0,True,2019-09-03

229,Would fb let the user know how many persons secretly unfollowed him?,"Some people really dont have the idea that their posts actually bother other people in a bad way. We all know some people like this. Someone may unfollow him but he still gets no idea and continue his bad postings on fb. He doesn't know people or friends are unfollowing him since fb doesnt show whether someone unfollows somebody. He still post those shitty things and gets some like as well or not. 
But if he gets to know that people are unfollowing him then he might have idea about changing his posting contents or not posting at all. Fb can show the number of users who already unfollowed him not showing the specific users' name.  Then it would be a good chance for one's friends to give their friend an idea that their posts r not  worthy enough to see and those actually hurt the eyes. It would not hurt the friendship since the guy would not know who specifically unfollowed him, he/she will only get the number of the unfollowed persons.",technology,1567523551,iknowwhatudo,1,1,True,2019-09-03

242,Facebook hiding likes.," 

**An engineer has discovered prototype code in Facebook's Android app which suggests it might test hiding the number of likes a post receives.**

Jane Manchun Wong found the code, which has not been activated.

Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, is conducting similar test in seven countries including Canada and Brazil, where only the account holder in the trial can see the number of likes they attract.

Facebook declined to comment.

Some studies have suggested the pressures of social media popularity can affect mental health, particularly in young people.

* **are we addicted to the 'like' button?**

Ms Wong wrote a blog post about her discovery, in which she emphasised that she does not work for the tech giant.

""It takes time to develop, observe, research and release experimental features like this,"" she said.

""Experimental features could come and go. But I am certain hiding the public like counts will be beneficial to the digital wellbeing of a large chunk of users.""

Venture capitalist Ellen Pao tweeted that the change - if it happens - is overdue.

""Social platforms have known as early as 2014 that social media impacts mental health and only now is Facebook starting to hide like counts,"" she said.

Instagram said it was not yet ready to share the results of its experiment.

""We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love,"" Mia Garlick, Facebook Australia and New Zealand director of policy, said in a statement when the Instagram trial was announced.

343,[Romania] My grandparents' router has been hijacked by a Chinese DNS,"So, this is extremely peculiar but, I was just coming here to visit, connected to the wifi and did normal YouTube stuff, all normal right?

Well I went on duckduckgo.com (default engine) and my Firefox has the spoofer to act like it's chrome and Firefox said it's a self certificate, okay, kinda weird, kinda suss, let's see what this is. It downloaded an app that claimed to be google chrome but like 500KB that I now deleted, perhaps I could get a hold of it again if I really wanted to. But it was extremely suspicious, blank pace. I went to see the source, lots of languages with the same message and checks for OS and browser. FIRST MESSAGE LANGUAGES BEING CHINESE. Ok, didn't really think much of it. Spoofed Safari iOS and it less me to a phishing appleid page. So I changed the DNS locally for my phone and then everything was fine.

I thought the issue was some sketchy DNS shit from the recently bought Tenda wifi extender but found no DNS setting, so I assumed it used the DNS of my router. Went to the router settings, **ROUTER CHANGED TO RUSSIAN**, uh big red flag, changed it back to English. Went and checked the DNS servers, with the results being 118.30.28.38 and 118.30.28.39.

So, we are looking to use our own modem/router, but don't really know what would be the best pick that has that sort of settings and that would be compatible.
