    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With the mandatory retirmemnt age of airline pilots being 65 years old, a lot of airline pilots are reaching the mandatory retirment age. According to CNBC, there will be a demand for 800,000 new airline pilots over the next 20 years. Ex-CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, says that \"the global pilot shortage will be one of the biggest challenges facing the airline industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines have tried to help train new pilots by creating Cadet Programs. The marketing team in our company wants to market cadet programs to people interetsed in aviation. To predict accurately which group they should market to, the marketing team wants to see from certain posts which category a user might belong to, Technology or Flying, and market to them. By marketing to a group that has an interest in flying, the marketing team will be able to reach people interested in aviation and expose them to this program, with the ultimate goal of having them sign up for cadet programs to reduce help employ pilots at an airline."

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    " I decided to collect data from two subreddits, Technology and Flying. After I gathered the data and saved it to a dataframe, I analyzed the shape and the type of data that was in there. There were nulls in the data but that did not affect me cleaning the data as they were not in the two columns we were looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a function that cleaned the data. The function makes all the characters lowercase, removes punctuation, whitespace, and html special entities, and lemmatized all the words. I then made a function to get the common words. This function prints the top 20 most common words. This was used to see which words were common. I decided to remove the common English stop words, flying, and technology as I wanted to make accurate predictions without having the name of the subreddit category in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made two models, each being tested with two vectorizers for train test split. I used Logistic Regression and MultinomialNB for my models and Count Vectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for my vectorizers. When the best model which had MultinomialNB and Count Vectorizer, I looked at the best ngram range and the max features. The best ngram range was (1,2) and max features was 1280.  I tested max features, stop words, and ngram range. The goal was to have the least number of true negatives with a high true positive. This model had the lowest false negatives with 44 and true positive at 409. The train score was 93 and .89. There is a little overfit but this model had the least true negatives which is good for the marketing team as they won’t market to people that are not their target audience."

    "The train and test score are overfit as there is a .04 difference.\n",
    "The cross val score shows us that it is very close to the test score. \n",
    "The best model is Logistic Regressresion with Cross Vectorizer. The way that I made the train score increase and decrease false positives was by looking at the max features and adjusting it. We adjusted it accordingly with the best estimator. Cross validation was looked at to make sure our model was doing well\n",
    "We have a true positive of 415 which we want to maximize and false negative of 37 which we want to minimize. It is important to have a higher true positive than false negative but it is more important to have less false positive as we don't want to waste money marketing to people who are not in the correct category This is good as it predicts the most number of true positives and the least number of false negative. This would let the marketing team market to the incorrect people which could waste their money as they would be marketing to the wrong group."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The model with multinomialNB and Count Vectorizer has test score of 0.89. This model has 37 true negative and 415 true positive. The 37 is really good as we want to minimize the number of people that are not the correct audience for the marketing team. We still want a higher rate for true positive but true negative is more important as we want to market to the correct people. This will save money on marketing. \n",
    "With this type of marketing, this should help increase the awareness of cadet programs and hopefully get more people to do them. This should help decrease the pilot shortage that is predicted in the future."
